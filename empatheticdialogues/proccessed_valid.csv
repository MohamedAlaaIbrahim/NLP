My heart went out to them  as their ribs were showing  but they were still so loving and sweet.,Hello,16
17,afraid,Yes  I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them.

28,surprised,What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.,My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.,28
29,surprised,Oh wow  I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.,Well  when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish  I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.,29

42,impressed,Thats great.,My daughter is very smart. She learns things really quickly.,42
43,impressed,Did you teach her?,Yes  she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.,43
44,confident,Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!,I can't believe how big the waves are. Hurricane Chris amped up my summer.,44
45,confident,That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. ,Yes  I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water. ,45

47,grateful,Wow  4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  ,I usually hate to ask for help  so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help. ,47
48,grateful,Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? ,That is so exciting  congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family  so having a great group of friends is really important to us. ,48
49,grateful,I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. ,Get involved in something. Church  a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups  for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!,49
50,proud,That sounds fun  I was never any good at painting,I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting,50
51,proud,That probably helps a good deal!,I am not either  but they had an instructor to follow along to! :),51
52,annoyed,I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!,That Jerk  Did'nt even wave when he cut me off. ,52
53,annoyed,That is terrible  he could have hurt the horse!,After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy. ,53
54,excited,Nice  congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?,So I got a new job recently  and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting!,54
55,excited,Awesome  I hope the job goes great for you!,It's pretty good so far  I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!,55
56,surprised,Thats sad  hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you,When I was a little girl  our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten. ,56
57,surprised,Haha thats crazy  I hope they became best friends  I love cats.,Well  we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home  or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.,57
58,sad,I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!,I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.,58
59,sad,Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.,Yes  the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.,59
60,anticipating,An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.,This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.,60
61,anticipating,I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.,Its really not  the foods not worth that long of a wait.,61
62,embarrassed,Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?,I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look. ,62
63,embarrassed,Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.,I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday. ,63
64,confident,That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!,A lady was having issues with a program on her computer  and I solved it with no problems!,64
65,confident,Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So  how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?,That sounds unpleasant  did you get in afterwards?,65
66,furious,Yeah  that is pretty annoying to have happen.,I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.  ,66
67,furious,Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.,I called them and did not hold back. ,67
68,jealous,It sounds like you're happy for her  which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?,My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired  but she got one right off the bat!,68
69,jealous,That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at  or still looking?,I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.,69
70,caring,I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.,My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital  and I go and see her as often as I can.,70
71,caring,She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!,Thanks  I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can  she's my world.,71
72,nostalgic,I am very nostalgic too  that must be a fun time!,I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go  I always feel super nostalgic.,72
73,nostalgic,That is true  but it is part of life  but it is cool to see things again  regain perspective,Yes  until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there  and you start feeling old,73
74,apprehensive,I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.,I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend  but when my girlfriend first moved into my house  I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way  and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.,74
75,apprehensive,Yes  sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!,I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath  and realize its just things  and it was just me being reluctant to change. ,75
76,sentimental,I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life,I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago  I was looking at some of my sons old clothes  and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me. ,76
77,sentimental,True  and the good thing is that when the kids grow  they provide moral support to parents.,Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it. ,77
78,surprised,Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!,I love a good surprise like anyone else; however  when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present  I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot. ,78
79,surprised,Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!,She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.,79
80,jealous,Is he a stay at home father  or does he just not want to work?,I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day  Not Fair!,80
81,jealous,I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.,He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.,81
82,surprised,Must of been pretty surprised  Also great to have friends like that.,So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room  a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off  and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock  and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience! ,82
83,surprised,That must of just made everything even better!,It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake  chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! ,83
84,surprised,That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.,I'm thrilled. I got a raise!,84
85,surprised,You are very lucky,Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.,85
86,terrified,No I haven't actually  I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. ,"Have you seen the film ""within"" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards  it was pretty creepy!",86
87,terrified,I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time  but if I do I will definitely check it out!,"Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out ""within""!",87
88,guilty,Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?,I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat,88
89,guilty,Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.,Very! It was a dark maroon stain. ,89
90,ashamed,Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations  which of course only makes it worse!,My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!,90
91,ashamed,"What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know  like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead  playing ""your"" song?",I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance. ,91
92,jealous,You should not be so insecure like that.,So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.,92
93,jealous,What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?,Its not about insecurity! ,93
94,anticipating,yes  several times.The place is magical.,Have you ever been to Las Vegas? ,94
95,anticipating,Well  you are about to have the fun of your life  but gamble responsible.,I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!,95
96,surprised,Why. Did you started dating recently or something,I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night  it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.,96
97,surprised,The most important thing is what you want.,No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!,97
98,confident,Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?,I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.,98
99,confident,Are you still competing on a professional level?,Yes  you can google me.,99
100,furious,NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously  I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!,I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.,100
101,furious,Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?,It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.,101
102,furious,Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!,A bowl of dry cereal. ,102
103,furious,I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!,Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.,103
104,impressed,I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?,Have you ever participated in any races  half or full marathons? ,104
105,impressed,That's great for her. ,I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon  it was inspirational!,105
106,afraid,hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?,I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day  my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark  I couldn't find my phone or a light  so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that  not at all  lol,106
107,afraid,OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?,I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is  I don't even believe in the supernatural  so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it  I think. ,107
108,prepared,That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?,Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.,108
109,prepared,Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!,I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..,109
110,lonely,I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?,My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.,110
111,lonely,Maybe one day if you have the time  you can pay him a surprise visit.,Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.,111
112,joyful,That is good. Where you running late,I made it on time to the bus stop.,112
113,joyful,That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind,I was running late and so did the bus.,113
114,guilty,I don't think you should feel bad  you didn't know!,So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.,114
115,guilty,I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.,Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.,115
116,guilty,Sounds like a good idea.,I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.,116
117,joyful,Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! ,I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however  that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water. ,117
118,joyful,That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.,Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim  and that one visit changed all that. ,118
119,sentimental,Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.,Oh today I heard one of Nannie's favorite songs on the radio.  It made me really miss our car rides together.  ,119
120,sentimental,I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her  that way she'll always be there in some form.,She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.,120
121,nostalgic,Yes  I love to visit the zoo!  ,Do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?,121
122,nostalgic,What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?,I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.,122
123,caring,That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.,My mother was always there for me when I was sick  annoyed and sad,123
124,caring,My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.,Well my dad too but my mum was so much more  even when I was naughty she was still there.,124
125,terrified,That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?,When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same. ,125
126,terrified,You need to fight your fear,I am  everytime I see a dog  I begin to run the other direction instantly,126
127,anxious,wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!,I actually have no friends  can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.,127
128,anxious,Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family ,No  it's not sad. I really like to be alone  as i'm an introvert. I need my space.,128
129,apprehensive,Yes I do actually  I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. ,Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?,129
130,apprehensive,I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. ,That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.,130
131,grateful,Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!,I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving  an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind,131
132,grateful,I bet  losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!,I was  it saved me a lot of problems,132
133,prepared,Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. ,I written down my notes on a double sided A4 paper  now I just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next 5 minutes.,133
134,prepared,Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released! ,Oh I did  I have been doing it for weeks!,134
135,jealous,Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!,An employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion,135
136,jealous,I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.,I definitely did not feel appreciated,136
137,embarrassed,That is hilarious. I bet.,When that happened to me  even the teacher couldn't stop herself from laughing. ,137
138,embarrassed,Oh my just the opposite LOL,I was so awkward and quiet in school  how about yourself?,138
139,hopeful,Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.,I can't wait to December when my first born arrives into the world. I'm going to make sure they have a great life.,139
140,hopeful,I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! ,Thanks I'm stressed  excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?,140
141,impressed,wow yes it is ,I was just speaking with my buddy. He is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend. Impressive!,141
142,impressed,He probably stored that up for his energy for the race,I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.,142
143,impressed,Haha oh wow  how was that for them,My friend stayed awake for 36 hours studying for the MCAT! ,143
144,impressed,Thats great  im glad she did well,she did well actually  i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!,144
145,furious,I hate it when that happens! were you ok?,I was commuting to work and a driver cut me off,145
146,furious,I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.,I made it out ok  just so irritating,146
147,joyful,That sounds nice! DId you have fun,I was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile,147
148,joyful,I'm glad you enjoyed yourself  it is important to make time for family.,It was great  felt refreshing to be around them,148
149,annoyed,I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that,I get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else. My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me  but that isn't the case. It happens every day. ,149
150,annoyed,Sounds like the best thing to do honestly,Yeah  it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around. ,150
151,anticipating,you will survive  and you have something to look forward to,I have an 8 hour shift in the office today but i can't wait to go home to see my boyfriend! ,151
152,anticipating,i hope your work day goes by fast,exactly  it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!,152
153,terrified,Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.,When I was 12  I got ran over by a truck. I was with my older cousin and his car messed up. Since he was my hero  I listened to everything he said  so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in. I listened. however  my 12 year old legs didn't make it and got trapped under the truck,153
154,terrified,I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?,"Well  he was 17 at the time  so in his defense  he just was being a ""dumb teenager"". My parents never let me go with him again after that though. ",154
155,hopeful,Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?,I only got a B- on an assignment i worked really hard on recently  but i'm working even harder now studying to ace the exam! ,155
156,hopeful,Congratulations! Studying can be hard  but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?, I do actually! ,156
157,embarrassed,Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!,I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed  I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants. ,157
158,embarrassed,Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!,Yes  I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole. ,158
159,afraid,Oh that sounds so scary!,I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car.,159
160,afraid,I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.,It was very scary  i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?,160
161,guilty,Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted,So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream. ,161
162,guilty,Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.,yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.,162
163,proud,Yes  I have an Associate's in Nursing.,Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future!,163
164,proud,Yes  it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!,Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others! ,164
165,annoyed,Holy smokes! Let me guess  better for the environment?,Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like. ,165
166,annoyed,You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet  but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!,yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.,166
167,confident,But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!,I scored a 95 on my promotion exam  I was upset that I missed one question.,167
168,confident,Oh  it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!),Thank you  I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?,168
169,impressed,I love the Autobahn.,On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car.,169
170,impressed,Yes I use to own an Audio.,I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast.,170
171,joyful,I have never done that  good job.,Last weekend I did something big. I finished my first 125 mile Iron man race. I'm still pumped.,171
172,joyful,You should. When is the next one.,That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.,172
173,sentimental,Oh wow thats cool.,Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back.,173
174,sentimental,Thats good you still think of him.,Yes  he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long. ,174
175,caring,Thats cool. Was it hard?,I went to a school for massage therapy  but I was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people I didn't know. ,175
176,caring,Wow that is a lot.,Some of it was. I had to learn the name  attachment point  and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800. ,176
177,annoyed,What do you get from your mom?,I think I get it from my mom. She would never open the door for uninvited guests.,177
178,annoyed,I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!,Being bothered by uninvited guests,178
179,excited,I love dalmatians.,My first dog was a dalmatian. We adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before I even had time to play with her. ,179
180,excited,How old was she.,She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played. ,180
181,annoyed,Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.,I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's. ,181
182,annoyed,Does she have like some other issues like mentally?,I didn't know her when she was young  so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable. ,182
183,sad,I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.,Have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?,183
184,sad,That is the worse  you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst  happens to me all the time.,yea  I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!,184
185,sad,So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had  or have you been unsuccessful?,Yes  I was angry and sad.,185
186,embarrassed,Wow  did they notice?,I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die.,186
187,embarrassed,They will forget about it soon.,yep  to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder. ,187
188,apprehensive,I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?,Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there.,188
189,apprehensive,That's the worst! You think you can trust people  and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.,They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.,189
190,joyful,That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?,I just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up. No more bad jibbers!,190
191,joyful,That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.,Yes  they are covering $4 500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth. ,191
192,afraid,I love Colorado  my favorite state.,I have a solo trip coming up. I'm going to Colorado to climb Mt. Elbert Solo. It's the tallest mountain in the united states.,192
193,afraid,I wish I could live there.,Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years  I'm getting the belly butterfly's. ,193
194,ashamed,Did you fart?,Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas.,194
195,ashamed,Did they smell?,It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time. ,195
196,apprehensive,Did anyone get hurt?,We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it. ,196
197,apprehensive,Thats good  as long as no one got hurt.,No  thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area. ,197
198,impressed,No training at all!  Wow  that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?,My husband just ran a Marathon. He had no training I was blown away by him. True inspiration! ,198
199,impressed,That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?,26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.,199
200,impressed,WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.,He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles  running  biking and swimming.,200
201,nostalgic,Wow you are brave.,I don't like saying this  and this is the first time I have but a few days ago I drove by my ex-wife and mine house  and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic. ,201
202,nostalgic,I bet you drove fast.,Yes  it was only a fleeting moment but it was there. ,202
203,terrified,Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it  I don't think.,I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little.,203
204,terrified,Have you ever done anything else so frightening?,Yea  until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.,204
205,terrified,I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me  I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!,Yes  I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it. ,205
206,apprehensive,At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.,Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?,206
207,apprehensive,Love  it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. ,Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?,207
208,apprehensive,yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.,Well congratulations for taking your time  look at it that way.,208
209,apprehensive,Hope so. I don't do well with heights.,Maybe try controlled breathing exercises  I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.,209
210,prepared,Oh  I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?,I had a huge exam that like 25 percent of my grade. I study for 2 weeks for it,210
211,prepared,Well  at least you didn't go down in your grade. But  it wasn't right to treat the students like that!,Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in  so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade,211
212,content,That is good  how old are you?,As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this.,212
213,content,I am 31 so same generation.,33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.,213
214,annoyed,Oh gosh  I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? ,Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry.,214
215,annoyed,Wow! In that instance  I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. ,Yes  I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something. ,215
216,confident,and did you knock it out of the park? ,I had studied for an exam for several days  so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it,216
217,confident,Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. ,Uh  I made a B on it   so it was a false sense of confidence  lol,217
218,anxious,Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.,When my son was 5 years old  he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing  but when they went to take him back  I got so anxious. ,218
219,anxious,That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.,Yeah  he was fine  but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't  but I did. ,219
220,angry,Oh  I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?,My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it. ,220
221,angry,I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.,We don't know them well  but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after  but some people have to get up for work. ,221
222,devastated,it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.,My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad  but necessary decision. ,222
223,devastated,She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.,It was very hard  but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not. ,223
224,content,Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?,My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit. ,224
225,content,Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?,About seven months. Too long. ,225
226,impressed,That's awesome! What did they talk about?,We had a really great guest speaker at work today.,226
227,impressed,Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?,He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.,227
228,impressed,Sounds like it was very exciting!,I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.,228
229,excited,Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.,I am a bit Breaking Bad fan and love Better Call Saul. Season 4 starts in August. ,229
230,excited,I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.,I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting. ,230
231,annoyed,I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?,I came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers. I was so irritated!,231
232,annoyed,I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!,Yes  it was my partner. He owes me big time,232
233,content,It happens to everyone  are you out of it now?,I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.,233
234,content,Oh well  it was nice to have someone to help you.,yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.,234
235,anxious,I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily,Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself.,235
236,anxious,Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.,Yes  I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.,236
237,anxious,yeah  and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them,I just don't think they're safe enough  many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.,237
238,angry,I bet you were  I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.,Two years ago  I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it  i was angry and hurt.,238
239,angry,I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.,I know it was a horrible experience at the time  now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up,239
240,nostalgic,Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them,I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times. ,240
241,nostalgic,Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them,That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?,241
242,nostalgic,Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life,Do you have a favorite era?,242
243,proud,Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed,Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.,243
244,proud,So if not by studying  what else?,I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college. ,244
245,angry,That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? ,I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!,245
246,angry,You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.,No  I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal  but it healed.,246
247,devastated,That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!,Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.,247
248,devastated,Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!,My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.,248
249,surprised,Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?,I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!,249
250,surprised,When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?,We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings  but mostly excited!,250
251,sentimental,That's too funny. You know  I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!,Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well  that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys  but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental ,251
252,sentimental,Yes  someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling,I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol,252
253,sad,I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?,I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago  and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago,253
254,sad,That's sweet  I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!,Yes  we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town  so it allowed me to get really close with her.,254
255,caring,Wow  that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?,I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday  when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.,255
256,caring,That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!,They couldn't capture him  he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.,256
257,lonely,What was the initial talk?,Yes  I was surprise on how he changed to another talk,257
258,lonely,So how do you feel when lonely?,I should descript how I could feel when am lonely,258
259,devastated,Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.,It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great  and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!,259
260,devastated,yes  i understood the first time.,It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great  and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!,260
261,ashamed,I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt ,I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.,261
262,ashamed,Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.,Even animals get embarrassed  I've seen it in my cats.,262
263,ashamed,Oh dang  talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol,Yes  my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.,263
264,jealous,That is a hilarious intro  thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things  you have nothing to worry about ;-)),One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened,264
265,jealous,These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov  you crazy kids!,"Well  I most def want to be insightful and intelligent  so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about  but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing ""Along Came Polly"" sceneros in your head. ",265
266,afraid,Is that good or bad? Why the concern?,Lately  my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls i don't even want to think of i,266
267,afraid,OK why do you think so?,I think it is bad,267
268,grateful,Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem,It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.,268
269,grateful,I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another  we would not have much problem,It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.,269
270,hopeful,Well you should try to study more and see what happens,My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.,270
271,hopeful,Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf,I did  I can't remember  I either made an A or a B in there.,271
272,surprised,THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.,Well  this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever  but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago  I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me  and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks  in the middle of the road  jumped out  and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short  I saw my own reflection in the mirror. ,272
273,surprised,That's hilarious  But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?,It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it  lol,273
274,surprised,Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared  especially during storms.,I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted  I am 32 now  lol,274
275,angry,I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :) ,Why no response?,275
276,angry,You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?,Is my response not good enough?,276
277,anticipating,Really?  Where do you live at?,It is really hot here most of the year.,277
278,anticipating,I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando  Florida.  So Im in the same boat.,Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.,278
279,annoyed,That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???,Ok I was in Walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection. Like it's some kind of internet forum!,279
280,annoyed,I would be scared of a guy like that.,"I dunno  but I just said ""That's great  bro"" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it.",280
281,lonely,Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?,This was several years back. I was single  but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie  so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake. It was a tear jerker  and I had no one there to see it and be like awe. All those tears wasted for nothing! lol,281
282,lonely,Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..,Oh  it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory  and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time  I was like I want that; however  now that I am in a relationship  I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well,282
283,joyful,You mean nostalgic?,I was joyful because my grandad shared the gospel with me when I was 11.,283
284,joyful,What your grand father did to you was very special.,I guess I am nostalgic now.,284
285,disgusted,That is not very considerate or respectful  plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.,Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street?,285
286,disgusted,I live in the country  so I do not have neighbors that live close. ,That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?,286
287,disgusted,I sometimes get freaked out  but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. ,How fortunate  my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories. ,287
288,disgusted,Yes. Peace is key.,That's true. You can live in peace.,288
289,ashamed,Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake ,I regret drinking way too much soda. Now my teeth look bad.,289
290,ashamed,You need to see a dentist then,I quit. Probably going to need some fillings.,290
291,annoyed,Just all the time.Who does not?,Have you ever felt really annoyed at yourself?,291
292,annoyed,It depends on the machine you are working on.,Yeah right now I dont know how to make a game install on another drive. Do you?,292
293,confident,Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?,This is a silly story  but it reminds me how confident teenagers can be. When I got my first tattoo  for some reason  it gave me this false sense of confidence. I am not sure why other than at the time I thought my tribal tattoo was something to admire,293
294,confident,That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool,I got it when I was 18. I didn't take care of it  so now it looks like a shady prison tattoo  lol,294
295,trusting,Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.,A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink  but I didnt have any cash  so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something,295
296,trusting,I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.,A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink  but I didnt have any cash  so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something,296
297,disappointed,Sorry! Try harder next time!,I never expected to fail my final exams that is a major blow for me.,297
298,disappointed,Never late you know!,Yeah  i know i ought to have taken my studies seriously.,298
299,surprised,That sucks. Are they mad or what?,Am surprised there is no response from my friend.,299
300,surprised,It's kinda annoying to me when people don't call you back.,Sucks? I don't know about sucks.,300

690,excited,My wife  LOVES taylor swift. ,I cannot wait to see Taylor Swift in concert!,690
691,excited,That is awesome  I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.,I actually went to high school with her. I cannot believe she is as famous as she is.,691
692,faithful,I am glad you love her  it must be a nice feeling,A female coworker came onto me at work the other day  but I refused her advances because I love my wife.,692
693,faithful,That is a good thing then,Yes  I just can't see myself being with another woman.,693
694,ashamed,That wasn't smart.,I cant believe I got arrested for a DUI this weekend  I let myself down.,694
695,ashamed,Why did you then?,I know I promised myself I wasn't going to drink anymore.,695
696,hopeful,Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?,I feel good about my last semester. I think I'll do better in my engineering classes this fall.,696
697,hopeful,Yeah  I think once you get in the field  you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that  you sound like you know what you're doing.,I'm doing mechanical  it's pretty hard but it's interesting. A career in the field would be awesome!,697
698,angry,Oh  the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.,I hate taking the but  today I was late to my stop and got there just as it drove away....,698
699,angry,Well  keep working at it. It's a process. ,I drove my parents' old car for a little  and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up  I hope I get one too.,699
700,excited,Where has he been?,I can't wait until I see my golden retriever Blue this weekend!,700
701,excited,Oh I bet you are excited then! He will be happy too!,I live away from my parents  he lives with them.,701
702,guilty,Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?,I saw a colleague stealing money at work. I wonder if I did the right thing by not telling my boss.,702
703,guilty,Is there a way you could report it anonymously?,I just didn't want to be labeled as a snitch  but now I'm having second thoughts.,703
704,angry,Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.,I hate when it rains  especially for several days at a time.,704
705,angry,It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.,How has the weather been where you are.,705
706,angry,Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.,Oh no  does that happen a lot when it rains near you?,706
707,nostalgic,"My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called ""Around the world"" and also one called ""The cradle."" Know those?",I remember when we used to compete with Yo-Yo's to see who could do the best tricks.,707
708,nostalgic,Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.,"Yes  my favorite was called ""Walk the dog"".",708
709,surprised,Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!,Last week we were at an amusement park and I cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us. He's usually afraid of heights.,709
710,surprised,Did he go on anymore after that?,I know  he usually never goes on dangerous rides.,710
711,prepared,Well he's young  so you can't really fault him.,My son got spaghetti all over himself at dinner at a restaurant one night.,711
712,prepared,That's good. You seem like a great parent.,I didn't really care too much. I had remembered to pack him an extra set of clothes though.,712
713,afraid,does it happen often in your part of the country?,I hate when it is storming it makes me so uncomfortable. ,713
714,afraid,wow.  i can only imagine,Yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high I hide under my covers lol.,714
715,embarrassed,Thats nuts.,I was using the toilet at Walmart yesterday and somebody walked in on me.,715
716,embarrassed,Did she scream?,Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom. It was the girls restroom. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.,716
717,excited,Did you get to? What happened?,I was finally going to get to see dolphins up close.,717
718,excited,I have never been there! Sounds fun  but I don't support Sea World and the way they treat their animals.,I went to Sea World for the very first time. We got to feed the dolphins.,718
719,afraid,OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs,Last week there was a huge tarantula on my wall. I thought it was going to jump on me.,719
720,afraid,i would have a heart attack!,OMG me too! I hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out. I had a panic attack and stomped on them.,720
721,sad,I know how you feel. Life is too short.,I will never forget the first time I felt old. I saw a video of grandparents playing with grandchildren and I realized it had been awhile since I did those things.,721
722,sad,Yes  you do! Just keep living everyday like your last.,yes  I try to remind myself that I still have a lot to offer.,722
723,impressed,wow  I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasn't hurt.,Yesterday we had a pool party. My brother got drunk and did a back flip off the roof and landed in the pool.,723
724,impressed,it does sound like an amzing feat,I wasn't mad at him. I just never knew he was that athletic.,724
725,lonely,ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it,I got on social media yesterday and saw that my friends went to a party  but they didn't invite me.,725
726,lonely,do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?,No  sometimes I feel like they just don't understand me.,726
727,anxious,Is your relative okay now?,Awhile back I was taking a relative to get a heart cath. The surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room.,727
728,anxious,It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.,oh yes  thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok. Kind of scary when I was sent for.,728
729,sentimental,Congratulations to him! You must be proud.,I got teary eyed when I watched my little brother get his diploma at graduation.,729
730,sentimental,He's very lucky to have you.,I am  every time he succeeds  I succeed. I love my big headed brother.,730
731,guilty,oh yeah what happened? ,I was supposed to drive a friend to work,731
732,guilty,omg is he upset? ,I forgot to pick him up as I overslept,732
733,caring,So did you help him / her,A friend needed help moving,733
734,caring,That's pretty nice of you,Yeah  he didn't know of anyone else to turn to for help so I gave him a hand,734
735,jealous,Wow  thats a nice car,Yesterday my friend bought the Ferrari I always wanted. I deserve it more than him.,735
736,jealous,It happens sometimes I guess,Yes  I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.,736
737,nostalgic,Memories.. what state? ,I was thinking about my old neighborhood,737
738,nostalgic,I understand but memories are always nice. ,Can't say  but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up,738
739,surprised,What happened with your car then?,I needed to use my car to drive somewhere  but couldn't,739
740,surprised,Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?,My car was hit while parked,740
741,embarrassed,I would love that show,I was at a Journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers. ,741
742,embarrassed,Oh well  it happens,It was a very good show  but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.,742
743,sad,Have you been to the doctor?,i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don't have any energy ,743
744,sad,You will be fine then,yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing ,744
745,proud,Well that is quite the accomplishment. ,Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition!,745
746,proud,He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.,It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.,746
747,anxious,Oh man  that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?,I now have a new boss  and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received.,747
748,anxious,Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out  but that may be me speaking too prematurely,He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations  and I have to say  I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other  so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.,748
749,furious,I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.,My mother will be 85 in a few days. My sister planned a surprise party knowing the day  hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend.,749
750,furious,That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.,It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.,750
751,angry,Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?,My cousin just called with the craziest story. She and her family are locked inside a cemetery.,751
752,angry,Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?,They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.,752
753,disappointed,I know it is hard to start letting go  but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry  you are not alone.,You hope your teens make the right choices  but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy  but I can help but want something different.,753
754,disappointed,Yeah  they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.,"That's what my own mother says.  In fact  she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said  ""Hey  I'm staying the night at so and so's  be back tomorrow.""  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!",754
755,impressed,That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.,I witness a great sight. I saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around.,755
756,impressed,Ohh  that makes sense. Yeah  then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.,The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.,756
757,terrified,I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad  I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?,I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news.,757
758,terrified,I'm so glad to hear it was good news  though!,I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it  and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news  but still had to have removed.,758
759,faithful,Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute  so cherish those you love!,Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.,759
760,faithful,It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!,It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.,760
761,joyful,Coming back to work could be good after a break.,I am off work for a month in the summer  but I today was my first day back  and it felt great to be back on a routine!,761
762,joyful,I understand,"A month is a great break to ""get away from the daily grind"" but believe me  at the end of week one you think oh  I have all the time in the world  and you aren't as productive.",762
763,embarrassed,That isn't good.,I still can't believe I did that. My power had been off and I didn't even realize it.,763
764,embarrassed,Did anyone help you?,I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward,764
765,anticipating,I wish I could feel that feeling  (unfortunately  I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?,When I was pregnant  I thought so much about what my son would make me feel!,765
766,anticipating,I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.,I named him George  men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.,766
767,lonely,I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?,Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.,767
768,lonely,Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.,I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.,768
769,caring,That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?,I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.,769
770,caring,Well  as long as you're doing something you enjoy  that's all that really matters.,I love my job  it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.,770
771,annoyed,Have you figured out what's the problem?,I have a table that is somewhat unsteady  I put my computer on there because I have no where else to put it. ,771
772,annoyed,Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? ,I have not  it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!,772
773,surprised,Yes? thats so cute  but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them,My 2 year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately.,773
774,surprised,OMG  well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them  and also when you are not with them!,I know!  She said the f word!,774
775,sentimental,Are you keeping it as a souvenir?,I went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets.,775
776,sentimental,Nice  I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.,I am  I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.,776
777,embarrassed,I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?,We recently went camping.  Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!,777
778,embarrassed,Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants  but there was probably none left!,We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!,778
779,sad,What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?,This Spring has really made me appreciate family.,779
780,sad,Ho  I am sorry to hear that.,My grandmother fell ill  and passed away.,780
781,angry,Too late I already took it. Just kidding  did you find it?,I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it,781
782,angry,Oh  that's bad. Was there anything important in it?,I did  they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!,782
783,impressed,Wao thats so cool you must so excited  how long has it been?,My son and wife are coming for a visit. Been a long time since I have seen them,783
784,impressed,Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son  sorry,about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west,784
785,prepared,Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?,I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies!,785
786,prepared,Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. ,When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!,786
787,faithful,That's cool. I am not a swinger either.,I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers  I'm a one man kinda lady.,787
788,faithful,How did you do it?,Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.,788
789,impressed,That makes no sense.,"After a full year of trying to get a leak fixed  I got help from a neighbor's roofer  who ""knew a guy.""  He said the guy didn't work on roofs  so I was confused!",789
790,impressed,That seems like a good price.,"Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there  the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out  this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the ""gutter"" on site  and I have had NO leaks!",790
791,disappointed,right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold,its so hot here. i've had to shower like 3-4 times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky. Hows the temperature at your place?,791
792,disappointed,haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home,what? where the hell do you live? what do you mean its freezing? oh my god i am so jealous,792
793,disappointed,aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer,ooooh you have an AC  thats why. I live in europe and AC's...arent a thing at all  only the occasional pharmacy will have an AC,793
794,sad,I'm sorry  How long has it been?,Oops. I meant I was upset when my dog died.,794
795,sad,That's always a tragedy.,Happened in Febuary.,795
796,apprehensive,That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?,Last week  my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression.,796
797,apprehensive,It probably went well  despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.,Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions  but I think they liked me.,797
798,joyful,Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?,We love going on our annual family camping trip  and just got back from it!,798
799,joyful,Oh no  What happened?,We went for a week  but did have to come back to town once.,799
800,grateful,Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?,I really love being in the great outdoors with my family!,800
801,grateful,Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?,We went camping  yes.  We're in the Midwest  so no mountains  unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.,801
802,hopeful,Did you get anything extra  like a bonus or a trip.,I did well on a project for a company,802
803,hopeful,Great. What business is it?,I think I might get promoted based on the work,803
804,angry,I can tell where this is going.,I was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk,804
805,angry,That has never happened to me. Thank god!,I got completely drenched  it was terrible,805
806,lonely,Well does that make you anxious?,I am a stay at home mom. School just started.,806
807,lonely,Oh  that would be rough. I've been through that too.,It does  this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.,807
808,devastated,Are you happy for him?,A close friend of mine has to leave the state for work,808
809,devastated,But if is a great opportunity for him  you should be happy.,Kind of  it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely,809
810,impressed,That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?,A friend was able to fix a problem I was having,810
811,impressed,Bah  those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.,Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own,811
812,annoyed,Why do you think they do that?,My coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary.,812
813,annoyed,That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.,They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.,813
814,terrified,Oh man  I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.,I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming.,814
815,terrified,Jeeeze  yea  it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?,We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced. ,815
816,terrified,It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long  happy  and fulfilling lives!,I love it here  except for the tornadoes and snakes. ,816
817,disappointed,That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?,I can't believe I spent 2 hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen. ,817
818,disappointed,Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?,Kiteboard but I left half the gear at home. The surf report said 10 foot waves and it's flat water. Not cool bro  not cool,818
819,terrified,Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.,In 6 days I leave for Peru,819
820,terrified,I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.,It's a surf trip. They have monster waves. I'm nervous. ,820
821,terrified,I live in Tennessee,Do you live inland? ,821
822,terrified,Wow. I must have a boring life then  because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.,I've been river surfing in Tennessee. You have some decent white water rivers that offer boating and also surfing.,822
823,annoyed,Oh no! How come?,Every single morning one lady on my team comes into my office and cry's,823
824,annoyed,Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.,You guess is as good as mine. She's crazy. Today she was stressed. Mind you she is 22 lives at home and has no bills.,824
825,annoyed,Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds. ,She did mention this morning that her doctor said she needs meds or locked up. ,825
826,excited,I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?,I can't decide how to spend the $100. I found next to my car this morning. ,826
827,excited,For sure! Any extra money is always good!,Don't really need anything but it was a great way to start the day.,827
828,guilty,Had she done that to you before?,I can't I went out with my ex's best friend while we were dating. I was a jerk but it was Karma biting her in the butt.,828
829,guilty,What a shame! ,Right before that I found out she was seeing other people while I was in Iraq.,829
830,guilty,Congratulations!,Yea  it worked out for the best. A few months after that I meet my wife and we have been together for 11 years now. First baby is on the way in December. ,830
831,surprised,Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?,Got on the scale this morning. Thanks to work stress I lost 15 pounds.,831
832,surprised,Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!,Yes  that or a new boss. I love my job but my boss is terrible.,832
833,jealous,Wow  what brand,I can see the kid's car from here. He is 16 and has a car work 100k,833
834,jealous,That is a nice car,Bmw 8 series. It's my neighbors kid. ,834
835,content,Yeah all the time. I get so jealous,Do you see a man and that yea he's got it going on?,835
836,content,Wow  that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!,Yea well I lost 25 pounds and now i'm that guy. Happy in my skin. ,836
837,anxious,That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?,Last time I climbed Elbert I started getting sick from altitude. Heading to Colorado next week to try to climb it again. ,837
838,anxious,Hahaha.  Well  I hope you don't get sick.  Take something salty with you  maybe that will help.  Have fun!,Yes  it's the tallest in Colorado. This will be my 3rd time climbing it. But the first time since I got old and Lazy. ,838
839,grateful,Congratulations. I bet you're happy!,Aced my Real Estate Exam today. Now I'm licensed in two states.,839
840,grateful,Do you work for a company or on your own?,Yea  time to advance my career now.,840
841,grateful,Cool beans,I'm self employed but new to the business.,841
842,anxious,Were you able to get it back?,I was recently waiting to hear from my old apartment about my security deposit refund. I needed the money to pay my new pet deposit  and wasn't sure if I'd get enough money back.,842
843,anxious,That's great! I bet that was a relief.,I was  and I ended up getting enough to pay the deposit and then some.,843
844,impressed,Wow  that should have been amazing,I was watching a video about a man who made a small table out of chocolate. It looked real and was just amazing. ,844
845,impressed,Me too  I love chocolate,It really was. It also made me want to eat chocolate. ,845
846,impressed,I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?,I was so happy to watch my friend do a backflip,846
847,impressed,Oh  that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?,I think he just took gymnastics classes. He luckily did not get hurt!,847
848,disappointed,Are you sick?,I hope the next doctor's appt. that I have goes well. Sometimes they aren't the greatest experience. ,848
849,disappointed,That sucks  I will pray for you.,Yeah  I have health problems  it's complicated. ,849

I'm convinced it's better to be poor in America then rich in Haiti.,1117

1147,hopeful,That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.,I was homeless for about a year.  It felt like every day I would just descened even further.  But I always held out hope that things would get better.,1147

1198,disgusted,I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to  but lately it just has so much rotten food,Some markets have to be avoided  that is if you valued your sense of smell.,1198
1199,disgusted,Totally. I still love to go have a look around,Yet there's still something about that imperfection  do you agree?,1199
1200,disappointed,Yes  it is partially true. What is the problem?,Don't you think that the only one really capable of bringing you down  is you?,1200
1201,disappointed,I understand.,There aren't any  I am just drawing a conclusion from past experience. ,1201
1202,angry,That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?,Sometime all it take is one rude person to ruin your day.,1202
1203,angry,Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.,Nothing major  but I am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice. ,1203
1204,grateful,Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.,when i went for shopping i parked my car at a no parking zone which i am not aware   police approached the car and was about to tow it away,1204
1205,grateful,Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies  too. Did they understand?,yes exactly   but i also had my 4 6 month old 11 month old baby with me .,1205
1206,grateful,That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.,ya after they had seen my 11 month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car . i felt very thankful to them,1206
1207,anxious,I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.,gosh ive been feeling so nervous for the past 24 hours  its almost like an impending sense of doom  To my knowledge theres nothing about to go wrong or blow up in my face but it feels like something is going badly,1207
1208,anxious,Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.,i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like  i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous  its really weird  very hard to relax like this,1208
1209,grateful,I think it's very common that we take things for granted. ,I've been recently thinking about the things we don't appreciate.,1209
1210,grateful,I think you can really think about all that you have  and show your thanks that you have these things. ,Is there anything that can change that?,1210
1211,lonely,What was depressing?,Yah  was depressing.,1211
1212,lonely,Oh  that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?,Well  just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact.,1212
1213,angry,What is the name of the show?,have you ever watched this show it was really quite good?,1213
1214,angry,No  I ever did.,It was called Hero's,1214
1215,anticipating,why hasnt it already been returned?,I am currently waiting to receive my security deposit back from my old apartment.,1215
1216,anticipating,if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner  i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you ,They said it takes up to 30 days  and it's only been a few weeks.,1216
1217,anticipating,yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me  Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you,Wow  that's good to know.,1217
1218,excited,That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl  but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.,I ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives,1218
1219,excited,I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago  but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.,i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it  i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it  and then just stop,1219
1220,nostalgic,what was ?,It was such a sweet moment.,1220
1221,nostalgic,oh that does sound nice,Spending time watching TV and sipping wine together.,1221
1222,hopeful,Well in some ways solitude is nice.,As the day was coming to an end  I was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect.  ,1222
1223,hopeful,True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.,Yes if you take it in portions. ,1223
1224,guilty,Be responsible about what?,But I needed to be responsible.,1224
1225,guilty,I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too  before I can go out.,Well  about getting daily chorses done--work first-- play later.,1225
1226,angry,Oh no  sorry to hear  hope you are OK.,I got backed into last week by another car.,1226
1227,angry,I agree. Hope the car will look good again.,I'm fine  but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car. Now I have to get it fixed  which is a hassle.,1227
1228,lonely,Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?,Meh i kinda feel bad  i wish i had family members to talk to,1228
1229,lonely,I understand,friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member  a spouse would be but i dont have that either!,1229
1230,embarrassed,I agree  where did you find them?,Yah  two colored socks is crazy.,1230
1231,embarrassed,Oh I see  Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!,LOL  mixed up in my drawer.,1231
1232,terrified,Was it an accident?,when i was travelling alone in a car at night in ghat road suddenly some boulders fell on the road ,1232
1233,terrified,Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close,no the boulders fell 50 meters infront of me   luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped,1233
1234,guilty,do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?,I ate so many macadamia nuts today  I don't know how to feel about it.,1234
1235,guilty,It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?,It the only nut that I can eat  that's why I can't help overeating.,1235
1236,annoyed,It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX,its sooooooo hot outside  30c. its borderline impossible to deal with,1236
1237,annoyed,That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs  so I feel your annoyance.,oh no  texas is basically in a desert isnt it. for me on top of heat i also get some 3 wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around  i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it. very annoying  apparently wasps love it though,1237
1238,hopeful,what job did you apply to?,I start back at work in a couple of weeks.,1238
1239,hopeful,Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society,I'm a teacher  so I've been off this summer. I am looking forward to having 12th graders again this year.,1239
1240,trusting,Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome,I always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice.,1240
1241,trusting,Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?  ,Do you ever disagree with your Mom?,1241
1242,trusting,Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?,Aww  I didn't really relate until I had children of my own,1242
1243,angry,I'm sorry to hear that,i was really pissed off when i found out my best friend slept with my girlfriend. i was shaking all over!,1243
1244,angry,:( did you stay friends with him?,yeah well. what you gonna do.. thats life..,1244
1245,joyful,did you get admission? ,i had recently applied for graduate masters in very prestigious universities but initially i was worried whether i get admission or not,1245
1246,joyful,That's great news  well done. ,yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted  but luckily i was admitted,1246
1247,joyful,:) ,yes i am totally relived of that stress now,1247
1248,anxious,Me too  especially when it's still the middle of the day.,I hate when I am tired.,1248
1249,anxious,Oh yes  you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!,or in the case here  morning,1249
1250,content,I think I am missing something  you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???,i ate 3 pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now  almost tranquility,1250
1251,content,It's definitely some kind of anomaly. ,yeah i know right  a lot  and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok  But i totally do feel great .,1251
1252,anticipating,What did you eat there? ,Sometime ago I was really hungry and decided to treat myself to some well reviewed restaurant  well it was all I hoped for.,1252
1253,anticipating,ooooh onion soup sounds really good  onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish,Onion soup with croutons.,1253
1254,disgusted,I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do? ,i was extremely disgusted when a close friend of mine threw up on my baby. he was really drunk at a party we were at,1254
1255,disgusted,Idk beat him up  lol. throw a drink at him  the sky is the limit! ,what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there,1255
1256,content,cool  how did it come by?,I just finished making my bulletin board at work.,1256

1258,furious,I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?,i was so angry when i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me.. dont know how i can forgive her,1258
1259,furious,Wow. I hope that you can work it out  but I would understand why you wouldn't want to.,3 years,1259
1260,nostalgic,really? well  who doesnt!,I really feel nostalgic around christmas,1260
1261,nostalgic,i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas,true.. there is something about that holiday that makes us wanna be kids again,1261
1262,surprised,wow  what was it?,my dad gave me the greatest gift ever on my graduation,1262
1263,surprised,woohoo! you are one lucky child!,a brand new ford car  i was thrilled,1263

1266,disappointed,I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up? ,i felt heartbroken when my girlfriend moved away without telling me first,1266
1267,disappointed,That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/ ,we had a fight  i never knew we were broken up though,1267
1268,joyful,What incident was that ?,hi there it was a hard day when this incident occured.,1268
1269,joyful,what happened then ?,i was driving home and it started to rain,1269
1270,sentimental,"I know what you mean  it sucks when those ""dates"" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! ",my dad passed away around the time of christmas.. it always casts a shadow over my holidays,1270
1271,sentimental,"Its not time to get over it  you arent doing any wrong its okay to ""feel"" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love! ",yeah.. i know it is time to get over it. but certain memories are so haunting,1271
1272,caring,i understand what you are saying  pets are always close to our hearts,i feel like my dog is my child time after another.. love him so much,1272

1276,faithful,yea thats probably the best choice to make,yesterday i was so angry at my parents.. but i kept my mouth shut and came away. i cant hurt them  i feel so faithful,1276
1277,faithful,i can understand that,i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up,1277
1278,disgusted,Yuck  that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?,some guy threw up on the street last night right before me.. i was grossed out,1278

1282,nostalgic,Those are great aren',i love thinking about fond memories with my family,1282
1283,nostalgic,Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :),do you have a large family?,1283
1284,terrified,wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle,My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However  there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately.,1284
1285,terrified,i can understand that,I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.,1285
1286,faithful,Do you think it was the right decision?,I got a job offer at another company that pays more  but I turned them down because I've been with my current company for ten years.,1286
1287,faithful,That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too,Definitely  my company always treat's me right. They haven't gave me a reason to want to leave. ,1287
1288,embarrassed,why is that,i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot,1288
1289,embarrassed,oh i can understand that,because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up,1289
1290,terrified,That must have been terrifying,The other day an intruder broke into my home. I had to hide in the closet while I called the cops.,1290

1293,proud,I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!,She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for.,1293
1294,joyful,That's nice  is she technologically savvy?,i was happy this morning when i received an email from my grandma,1294

1300,confident,What did you bet?,I bet my cousin that I could beat him at a game of basketball. He's horrible at playing so I knew I could beat him.,1300
1301,confident,That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?,I bet him $1000 because that's how good I am. I had no doubt in my mind I could win. I ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too.,1301
1302,sad,Oh no  I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.,i was sad to hear my mom is in the ER again,1302
1303,sad,I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.,me too  she has heart problems unfortunately,1303
1304,proud,Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?,My son said his first word the other day. My little man is going to be smart just like his pop's.,1304
1305,proud,That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!,He said poop. When I heard It I jumped up with joy. That's my boy!,1305
1306,jealous,Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!,im envious of my friends who are at the park right now while im stuck inside,1306

1308,afraid,You should have taken a flashlight just in case. ,I was walking through a trail to get to my house last night and it was pitch black. I was afraid a bear or something might get me lol,1308
1309,afraid,hey at least you got a nice workout in!,I was gonna use my phone but it died  so I just sprinted for like half an hour.,1309
1310,afraid,That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.,Yeah way to look at it positive lol. There was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing.,1310
1311,disgusted,I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick, i felt sick after eating too much ice cream last night,1311
1312,disgusted,Ha  at least it was good,its my own fault i went past my limit lol,1312
1313,caring,Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?,I took my pup to the park last weekend and he had fun meeting other dogs and their owners!,1313
1314,caring,Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.,Yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol. He will go up to people and not leave until they pet him.,1314
1315,caring,He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.,Absolutely! What kind of dog do you have?,1315
1316,ashamed,lol  it happens to us all,So I was drunk coming back from a party and woke up to find I peed the bed lol. First time in like 24 years.,1316
1317,ashamed,haha true,Yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something  at least I did lol.,1317
1318,embarrassed,That sucks did you need to return something?,i felt dumb when I lost my receipt,1318
1319,embarrassed,That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.,yes some printer ink,1319
1320,annoyed,Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?,So I was on the bus back from a party and a drunk guy barfed on me at a stop lol. Most of it got on my jacket and he didnt even apologize.,1320
1321,annoyed,That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.,Well I didn't want to start a fight or anything  so I just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride. Then I washed it like 6 times lol,1321
1322,prepared,i hope you do really well,I can't wait for college in the fall! I left 2 years ago and am back feeling more confident in my studying abilities.,1322

1328,proud,Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!,Oh I am going back in a few weeks. It will probably be hard but I will enjoy it for sure.,1328
1329,lonely,I do like the rain though,So last weekend it poured rain all day and I chilled at my house by myself. Pretty boring.,1329
1330,lonely,I am sure you will have plans again,It is relaxing  the only thing is that you can't do anything outside really. Had some plans but they got canceled.,1330

1333,jealous,Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous  and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).,Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure.,1333
1334,impressed,I take you don't have issued with you weight.,Yesterday  I ate a whole pizza by myself!,1334

1342,lonely,Well we are friends aren't we? I do appreciate you as one.,I don't have a lot of friends.,1342

1567,confident,that is a good tactic actually  it boosts your confidence,I always make sure to self assure myself before i go for an interview,1567
1568,confident,Very true. We should believe in ourselves for others to do that,Yeah  and confidence is key in winning those right,1568
1569,devastated,Oh my god  sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?,I was so terribly sad when my granny passed away..,1569
1570,devastated,How sad.. Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now,Yeah  very much. She was the one who looked after me.,1570

1573,anxious,That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?,I gave a long  drawn out presentation at school the other day. I found the task to be very daunting.,1573
1574,anxious,Me  too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now  right?,Horrible  my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds.,1574
1575,jealous,Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.,My friend got accepted into Harvard University. That's my dream school. I don't understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there  and i'm stuck at community college.,1575
1576,jealous,Yep  that's the way of the world  especially with Universities to.,That's what i'm thinking  it's not what you know it's who you know.,1576
1577,surprised,A duplicate? Like a fake?,i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product,1577
1578,surprised,That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.,yes i received a fake product   the make of earphones is very well known brand ,1578
1579,annoyed,Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?,I had the worst day ever yesterday.  I had just finished a long  hard day at work  I had driven the 40 minutes home  was just driving into my street and realised that I had left my bag with phone  purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office!,1579
1580,annoyed,Ah yes  a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still  what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. ,Well I wanted to cry and scream  I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol.,1580
1581,annoyed,I would be so lost without my phone  but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! ,Exactly  so irritating.  But hey you live and learn  I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me!,1581
1582,surprised,Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?,I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card.,1582
1583,surprised,So  it was your partner who used you card,No not at all  She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.,1583
1584,afraid,Oh no! Was anyone hurt?,one month back i went for a wildlife safari   where i was attacked by a wild boar ,1584
1585,afraid,That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?,ya i had bruises on my leg ,1585
1586,afraid,Are you willing to go on another safari?,it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience.,1586
1587,afraid,I'm not surprised.,no i am done with such trips.,1587
1588,jealous,That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.,My husbands brother was getting married.  I searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress.  I finally found it  tried it on and loved it.  I couldnt buy it until the following week as I had to wait to payday so I left it over in the store.  The next day my sister in law called in.  She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment.,1588
1589,jealous,That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.,Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day...,1589
1590,sentimental,You are telling me you are a hoarder?,I never can get myself to give away their baby items. ,1590
1591,sentimental,Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine,lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect.,1591
1592,ashamed,Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.,I was walking down the street yesterday in my brand new summer dress.  I though i was gorgeous! Suddenly a big gust of wind came and blew my dress up around my ears! Where I succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street.  Oh the embarrassment.,1592
1593,ashamed,I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though,Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.  Later though I chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it.,1593
1594,terrified,That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.,I so get how you feel because I decided to watch Insidious the other night on my own.  I scared the life out of myself afterwards because I thought I kept seeing shadows and hearing noises and had myself convinced someone or something was in the house with me!,1594
1595,terrified,Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.,Oh no just my vivid imagination lol.  I do love a good horror but usually I watch them with my husband.  I am clearly not as brave on my own!!,1595
1596,surprised,That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.,I helped a doctor's assistant over a couple of months,1596
1597,surprised,That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.,It was she wasn't really good ans i had no problem helping,1597
1598,disappointed,I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.,my car had a small accident recently,1598
1599,disappointed,Do you have full cover?,no it was a minor accident   but car got damaged little,1599
1600,afraid,Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?,I never did find out why there were so many police cars there today.,1600
1601,afraid,Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.,In town  I had my kids with me to buy school supplies.,1601
1602,sentimental,Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?,I found my old high school yearbooks that other day. ,1602
1603,sentimental,Yeah  we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.,I think that I didn't appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then! ,1603
1604,content,That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!,I am feel pretty mucky things have been pretty stable at home.,1604
1605,content,Cherish this time you have  because you never know when it could change!,Yes I am and thankful since I have 3 young kids at home  ,1605
1606,excited,What restaurant is it for? ,I got a gift card to a restaurant I've been wanting to try for a long time. ,1606
1607,excited,Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.,It's a local non-chain Greek restaurant. It's fancy and supposed to be very good. ,1607
1608,anxious,That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?,I went on a blind date last week. Honestly  I didn't know what to expect at first.,1608
1609,anxious,Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.,It was alright  but it was hard to find common ground at first.,1609
1610,apprehensive,Oh no  I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?,I have a dentist appointment tomorrow. I think I have a cavity.,1610
1611,apprehensive,Dang  that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that,Yes  but I think I'm genetically hosed when it comes to teeth. I really hate it. ,1611
1612,proud,Wow  you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!,My son scored a perfect 1600 on the SATs!!,1612
1613,proud,Geniuses don't do chores my friend.,I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer  but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!,1613
1614,content,I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it  though. ,I went to my moms funeral yesterday  but surprisingly I wasn't sad at all. I was at peace because she accomplished a lot during her time here on earth.,1614
1615,content,But a part of her is still here in you. ,Yeah  she's in a better place now.,1615
1616,lonely,They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...,My husband and sons left town for weekend. ,1616
1617,lonely,I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence,Yeah  it was cool for a while  but the house is way to quiet now,1617
1618,angry,Whoever ate it all is evil!!!,So  I bought myself a box strawberry frosted pop tarts last week. Today I went to go have one for breakfast...GONE! ,1618
1619,angry,I know right. I would be so furious!,I need to interrogate everyone in this house. I'm so angry. You don't mess with Mom's Pop Tarts!,1619
1620,angry,I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.,My neighbor was having a party last night and wouldn't let me sleep. I felt like going out there and giving him a piece of my mind!,1620
1621,angry,Yeah  something should be done about it!,No  next time I might snap. They never show any consideration for anybody on the block. They do whatever they want.,1621
1622,guilty,I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!,My friend wanted to go to lunch today. I told her I was busy  but really I just didn't want to go...,1622
1623,guilty,Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!,Well  I do feel a little guilty  just sitting here on my couch watching tv,1623
1624,disgusted,Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?,So...the sewer line backed up into our house last week. ,1624
1625,disgusted,What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?,It was truly disgusting. We had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard.,1625
1626,excited,That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier  him or you?,My brother got out of prison yesterday! It felt so good to see him after such a long time.,1626
1627,excited,He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!,Definitely me  I gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates.,1627
1628,grateful,Ugh  I hate when unexpected expenses arise.,The transmission in my car died last week. Such an expensive repair,1628
1629,grateful,Well  that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.,Fortunately  my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it. ,1629
1630,jealous,Wow  great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!,My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2! ,1630
1631,jealous,Well  keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.,I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious. ,1631
1632,surprised,Please tell me you won a lot of money.,On a whim today  I bought a scratch off card at 7/11,1632
1633,surprised,lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.,Not a lot - $100. But that's $100 more than I had when I woke up this morning. I was so surprised I did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter,1633
1634,angry,OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?,My kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet. I told them not to brink food  or drinks in the living room. When will they learn?,1634
1635,angry,Hopefully they remember,Yes  but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed. I gave them a spanking that they will never forget. I'm not putting up with this no more.,1635
1636,embarrassed,Did you brush it right out?,I had a salad for lunch yesterday  then went shopping at the mall. When I got home around 7pm I discovered I had a HUGE piece of spinach between my front teeth!,1636
1637,embarrassed,Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?,I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!,1637
1638,apprehensive,You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!,My friend invited me to a pool party  but I don't know how to swim. I told her I would think about it.,1638
1639,apprehensive,Yea  and you can bring some water toys to play with!,I'm not sure  I might just stay in the shallow part of the pool.,1639
1640,confident,Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?,I went to a wedding this weekend. I've recently lost a ton of weight so I bought a new dress for the occassion. ,1640
1641,confident,How much total weight did you lose  and how long did it take?,Yes. I've wanted to be healthier  but I also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event. ,1641
1642,excited,Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?,I'm leaving for vacation on Wednesday!,1642
1643,excited,Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds,On a cruise to Havana. I'm so excited!,1643
1644,prepared,Aww man  I hope you brought your raincoat.,I got caught in a huge rainstorm last week. It was a deludge. ,1644
1645,prepared,That's good  you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.,Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house. ,1645
1646,surprised,That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!,My brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday. I wasn't expecting him to come. I thought he was still stationed in Iraq.,1646
1647,surprised,Did you get a video of it?,Totally  I was in shock.,1647
1648,impressed,Gee  he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!,Once  at a Waffle House near Memphis  I heard a man order 15 eggs over-easy. ,1648
1649,impressed,Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is. ,I stayed to watch to see if he'd eat them all. He did. I was very impressed.,1649
1650,embarrassed,Oh dang  that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far  it must've been super embarrassing. ,TSA made me pull down my pants in front of everybody at the airport yesterday. They thought I was a bomb threat.,1650
1651,embarrassed,Dude  you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.,Yeah  I will never show my face there again.,1651
1652,afraid,Oh yeah  what was it called? I really love roller coasters!,I rode the largest roller coaster I've ever ridden this summer. ,1652
1653,afraid,I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!,Millenium Force  in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying. ,1653
1654,hopeful,Oh  I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.,I'm waiting to hear back from a few colleges about scholarships.,1654
1655,hopeful,All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.,Yes  I think my stats are good. I'm hopeful there will be some good news soon.,1655

1657,excited,Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!,Super excited! These two have been together forever. It's about time they made it legit!,1657
1658,impressed,Wow  that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?,I went to a fancy art showing at a gallery last night.,1658
1659,impressed,Gee  she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!,It was watercolors. My neighbor was the artist. I had no idea she did such great work. She also has two toddlers. I have no idea how she manages all of that.,1659
1660,impressed,Did you feel very emasculated by this?,I thought I could lift  but my wife upstaged me by benching 150 lbs at the gym the other day. I can only lift 130 lbs.,1660
1661,impressed,Yeah  I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!,No  it actually turned me on. I didn't know she was that strong.,1661
1662,grateful,I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?,My son came back from a camping trip last night. I was great to have him safely home again. ,1662
1663,grateful,My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!,He did. I'm a worrier  but I need to learn to let go more. ,1663
1664,nostalgic,Oh wow  I bet the emotions of that came back to you.,I came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids.,1664
1665,nostalgic,Yes  those memories are what make life so special.,Yes  it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband  pre-kids. Very sentimental.,1665
1666,anticipating,So  not a surprise  but still nice to get? ,I got a car for my birthday  but I kinda knew I was going to get it beforehand because I kept telling my wife I wanted it.,1666
1667,anticipating,That's sweet. ,Yeah  kind of ruined the surprise  but I can always count on my wife to make me feel special.,1667
1668,caring,Wow  thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.,I donated $1 000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It's for a great cause that's very important to me.,1668
1669,caring,I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.,I agree  we should protect and nurture animals  not abuse them. ,1669
1670,sentimental,Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.,i miss my childhood and living with my parents,1670
1671,sentimental,That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.,yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.,1671
1672,annoyed,Oh yeah  why is that?,i live next to a football field and every football season i hate living here,1672
1673,annoyed,I would have them towed!,Because they park in my driveway!,1673
1674,annoyed,Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?,i have signs up this year  so i can do that legally!,1674
1675,annoyed,Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.,Yes. Which i think is wrong.  If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.,1675
1676,surprised,That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?,my husband treated me to a week at disney  i had no idea!,1676
1677,surprised,Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!,disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .,1677
1678,content,That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?,i am pretty happy right now  i don't think i have ever been happier with my life.,1678
1679,content,You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy. ,Exactly! I used to struggle but i don't anymore,1679
1680,trusting,that's great that you can trust her.  how old?,My daughter went out of town  but she promised me she wouldn't do anything I wouldn't approve of  and I believe her  so I let her go.,1680
1681,trusting,That's great. Be thankful  some people aren't so lucky.,Yeah  she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.,1681
1682,annoyed,what did you almost buy?,Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing at Walmart!,1682
1683,annoyed,It's hard to find good quality at walmart,It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad  but when I got there  it looked cheap and shabby!,1683
1684,annoyed,I would try target.  good quality stuff there.,I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else  right?,1684
1685,annoyed,try googling it  and read thru the reviews,I could try online  but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.,1685
1686,hopeful,Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?,i am trying to sell my house  i hope i can find a buyer,1686
1687,hopeful,Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate  right?  Location  Location  Location.,I hope i do.  We will see  I know it can take a while.\,1687
1688,hopeful,Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then,yes i live behind a school.,1688
1689,hopeful,You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?,yes  but i will leave that to the listing agent.,1689
1690,furious,Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?,I had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus.,1690
1691,furious,Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now  with a manager who cares.,"He was the ""marketing manager"" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag  it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse.",1691
1692,afraid,Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?,i am concerned about my father,1692
1693,afraid,Aw  I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age. ,he is old  and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok  but i don't know how much longer.,1693
1694,afraid,We can surely hope! ,no it's not  but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.,1694
1695,guilty,That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?,My neighbor asked me to watch over his dog. I told him he could trust me  but he escaped and ran away.,1695
1696,guilty,I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.,I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No  but I put up a lot of posters  so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.,1696
1697,angry,Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?,I used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing League of Legends  he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night.,1697
1698,angry,You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.,His parents paid his bills so no  he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.,1698
1699,apprehensive,What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?,i have a new job offer  but im not sure if i should take it,1699
1700,apprehensive,Yeah  I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job  considering dealing with the public  hours during holiday seasons  etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good  it can outweigh some of the negatives.,well  it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.,1700
1701,impressed,lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro   thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time,So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it  I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.,1701
1702,impressed,wow   i would love to have a cat like yours ,I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.,1702
1703,lonely,Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?,I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.,1703
1704,lonely,haha that must have been a crazy concert! ,It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.,1704
1705,jealous,Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as  say  an administrative job,This friend of mine is constantly job hopping  I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily  whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.,1705
1706,jealous,Well  I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture,She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.,1706
1707,prepared,OOO I love doing that  but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?,I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.,1707
1708,prepared,Still  a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!,I finished my kitchen  so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really. ,1708
1709,joyful,That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?,This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.,1709
1710,joyful,Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!,I don't know  I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.,1710
1711,sentimental,I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff,I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little  how different the world was.,1711
1712,sentimental,Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids,Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!,1712
1713,surprised,I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?,For my birthday last year  a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!,1713
1714,surprised,Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?,Smoked gouda  one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha,1714
1715,caring,Aww poor baby  hopefully shes doing fine now.,My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled  poor thing was in so much pain.,1715
1716,caring,That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.,She's doing great  thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.,1716
1717,nostalgic,Ha  I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.,When I was a kid  I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's  just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.,1717
1718,nostalgic,True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!,Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.,1718
1719,anxious,Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?,I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.,1719
1720,anxious,I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!,They said within the week  I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!,1720
1721,embarrassed,Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?),Unfortunately  I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.,1721
1722,embarrassed,"I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like ""okay  so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?"" Heartfelt apologies go a long way  and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.",I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!,1722
1723,annoyed,Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?,I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order. ,1723
1724,annoyed,I would have complained.,It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.,1724
1725,lonely,Ohh  I feel sorry for you,Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away  I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.,1725
1726,lonely,Ohh  that's bad. You can always skype your family!,Oh don't feel bad  I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.,1726
1727,content,Yes  I feel you. Cleaning sucks  but after all that hard work  the results are amazing!,I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.,1727
1728,content,Me too! You seem just like me!,Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.,1728
1729,excited,That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?,My husband and I closed on our first house last week!,1729
1730,excited,That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness  joy and fun times!,It is! Lots of blood  sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things  haha. We can't wait to move in!,1730
1731,terrified,Are there any other family members out there that could help her?,my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.,1731
1732,terrified,Wow  I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home  but I'm sure she figured something out.,No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.,1732
1733,confident,That's great! I am happy for you!,Recently I was contacted by my former company  begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.,1733
1734,confident,Yeah  and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!,Thanks  I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week  it's pretty amazing.,1734
1735,surprised,i honestly have never gone to jury duty   but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule ,i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !,1735
1736,surprised,same thing i heard too   really long and boring being there against your will ,yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.,1736
1737,sad,I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past  so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.,My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.,1737
1738,sad,Aww that's great! What breed? ,She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently  which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives. ,1738
1739,terrified,Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?,The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.,1739
1740,terrified,Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me  I can't imagine being there for that long,Yes  thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!,1740
1741,sad,I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.,my doggie recently passed away,1741
1742,sad,Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!,no i don't think so  but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  ,1742
1743,disgusted,oh man  that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.,The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.,1743
1744,disgusted,how many cats do have?,Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey  I should have known better and watched where I was walking.,1744
1745,sad,Aw  I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?,My dog died last year. ,1745
1746,sad,They say dogs are mans best friend. ,About 5 years. He was a rescue.,1746
1747,sad,What kind of dog was he?,That's true. He was definitely mine.,1747
1748,sad,Nice  I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. ,He was a pit and lab mix.,1748
1749,devastated,Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago  I know how terrible that feels.,The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.,1749
1750,devastated,Neither did we. He seemed so healthy  and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day ,I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.,1750
1751,surprised,surprise gifts are always fun.,The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.,1751
1752,surprised,that sounds like a well deserved plan.,Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.,1752
1753,excited,Oh man  I can relate  that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment,I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters  but just being there changed my mind quickly.,1753
1754,excited,Life is full of experiences like that  they seem scary from the outside  but once you relax you get swept away,Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.,1754
1755,disappointed,that sounds prettty bad!,i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it,1755
1756,disappointed,I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.,yes  i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.,1756
1757,disappointed,Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!,i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.,1757
1758,annoyed,I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. ,I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.,1758
1759,annoyed,The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.,The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly. ,1759
1760,disappointed,What store were you at? ,I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.,1760
1761,disappointed,Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? ,I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. ,1761
1762,grateful,Aw man  I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? ,it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared ,1762
1763,grateful,Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.,thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!,1763
1764,grateful,That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.,yes she is honestly the greatest ,1764
1765,guilty,Oh  I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets  but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol,I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?,1765
1766,guilty,That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.,Right! It's almost like  you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!,1766
1767,annoyed,Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.,I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout  I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.,1767
1768,annoyed,Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.,Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.,1768
1769,jealous,Oh man  that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?,When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.,1769
1770,jealous,Sounds like your friend broke bro code  that was kind of scummy.,"Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my ""friend"" asked her out.",1770
1771,surprised,Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that,I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.,1771
1772,surprised,That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times,Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.,1772
1773,proud,That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now,I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.,1773
1774,proud,That's awesome  she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!,Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.,1774
1775,surprised,Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?,I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.,1775
1776,surprised,Bills do take up a lot  don't they.,Oh they are long gone lol. Bills to pay and all.,1776
1777,afraid,Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?,One time I moved into a new apartment  it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound  I thought the place was haunted!,1777
1778,afraid,How did you discover exactly what it was?,Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.,1778
1779,anxious,Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?,I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.,1779
1780,anxious,I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!,Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. ,1780
1781,sad,I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.,I had to put my cat down a few years ago  she was old and in kidney failure.,1781
1782,sad,You went through a lot of losses.,She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat  she came to live with me when my mom died.,1782
1783,embarrassed,That sounds painful  I hope you were okay after your fall. ,Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle. ,1783
1784,embarrassed,Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing  but I'm glad you're okay. ,I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly. ,1784
1785,hopeful,Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!,I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.,1785
1786,hopeful,Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?,I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.,1786
1787,excited,I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?,I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.,1787
1788,excited,The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?,Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.,1788
1789,ashamed,Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?,I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.,1789
1790,ashamed,I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!,You're right  the other people probably hardly noticed. And no  thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.,1790
1791,prepared,How'd the hurricane go?,This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries  canned goods  beer. I was set!,1791
1792,prepared,Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.,Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest  though glad we were safe.,1792
1793,apprehensive,Was he okay?,I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.,1793
1794,apprehensive,Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.,He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it  he is a very nervous dog.,1794
1795,apprehensive,Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.,That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.,1795
1796,apprehensive,I bet he is. Don't worry,I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.,1796
1797,prepared,That is a great idea,I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.,1797
1798,prepared,Saving money is important,Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track. ,1798
1799,proud,That's amazing! You must be so proud.,My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year,1799
1800,proud,She's also a hard worker.,Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.,1800
1801,impressed,That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.,Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice  there were A LOT of bags.,1801
1802,impressed,Good to know there is still kind people in the world.,It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it  I didn't want to hold him up. ,1802
1803,surprised,That's awesome! Who were they from?,I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.,1803
1804,surprised,That was really sweet of him  maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.,My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.,1804
1805,prepared,You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.,I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband  our four kids  and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though,1805
1806,prepared,That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!,I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. ,1806
1807,anxious,We all do things we regret when drinking,I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.,1807
1808,anxious,Thats usually how it goes,True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days  worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.,1808
1809,apprehensive,You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?,A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.,1809
1810,apprehensive,hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.,It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.,1810
1811,hopeful,I wish you luck,I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.,1811
1812,hopeful,I am sure you will meet them,Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.,1812
1813,lonely,That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?,I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.,1813
1814,lonely,I would have been disappointed  too. ,Yeah  he acted like it was just a normal day  it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.,1814
1815,annoyed,Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.,I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer. ,1815
1816,annoyed,Oh right  I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.,Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next. ,1816
1817,impressed,Cool. Was it interesting?,I went to a book release party yesterday.,1817
1818,impressed,Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol,Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.,1818

1822,grateful,Awesome. What is your job?,For over exceeding and helping all staff when in need  I am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work.,1822
1823,excited,Wow was it a scam or was it legit?,I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher,1823
1824,excited,That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?,I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!,1824
1825,embarrassed,Oh no  what happened?,"There was an ""incident"" at the gym today.",1825
1826,embarrassed,Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!,I finished a fabulous workout  then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.,1826
1827,joyful,That's great. Are you excited?,After four long  broke months of looking  I finally got offered a job today!,1827
1828,joyful,Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.,Yes  and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills. ,1828
1829,surprised,Was it real?,I had an email telling me I had a $120 gift voucher this morning,1829
1830,surprised,That's awesome. What are you going to buy?,Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!,1830
1831,surprised,Australia. I hope to go there some day,Thanks! No idea actually  it's for a department store here in Australia,1831
1832,surprised,I bet  I will get there one day,You definitely should! It's a really cool place  but so hard to see everything because it's so big,1832
1833,guilty,I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother,I knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when I was riding my bike. I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going.,1833
1834,guilty,Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks,I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.,1834
1835,disappointed,That has happend to me too.,I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.,1835
1836,disappointed,You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though,I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.,1836
1837,disappointed,We live and we learn lol,That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.,1837
1838,nostalgic,I used to love that band,The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days.,1838
1839,nostalgic,I have not either,Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff  I haven't listened to any of it in years.,1839
1840,annoyed,Probably at 4 or 5! lol,So the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between 8:30 and 12:30 on Friday. Guess when he showed up....,1840
1841,annoyed,No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?,You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting. ,1841
1842,excited,Was it real because I get those every day lol,I got a random email telling me I had won a gift card,1842
1843,excited,I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol,Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120,1843
1844,prepared,oh no! what happened?,We had a near-disaster at our house today.,1844
1845,prepared,ah  crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse,My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately  we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.,1845
1846,content,Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.,We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.,1846
1847,content,That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy,"It was good! It always is. I had my ""usual"" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed  but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday.",1847
1848,grateful,Hm  that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation  since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened  or what did that mean?,I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location,1848
1849,grateful,Oh  so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm  no foul.,Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep,1849
1850,hopeful,I bet that was a nice feeling,I recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back. It was kind of exciting  I really wanted it to work out.,1850
1851,hopeful,That sounds perfect,It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!,1851
1852,anxious,The dentist makes me a bit nervous,I have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning. ,1852
1853,anxious,Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!,It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it. ,1853
1854,furious,That is awful  did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? ,I got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car. ,1854
1855,furious,You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot  maybe they can track down the car.,No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed. ,1855
1856,impressed,What kind of food was there?,I went to the fanciest dinner party the other night. It was  eight amazing courses of food!,1856
1857,impressed,It is nice that you enjoyed it.,Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.,1857
1858,terrified,Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?,I saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night. I woke everyone up with my screaming.,1858
1859,terrified,Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well,Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.,1859
1860,devastated,Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.,My kitty that I had since she was a kitten passed away. She was only four years old.,1860
1861,devastated,It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well  just think of all the good times and be thankful.,"It really is. She was the first pet that was really ""mine"". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!",1861
1862,confident,That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests,I had a test the other day and I'm pretty sure I aced it. I studied for like a week!,1862
1863,confident,Oh yes. But  I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle  but important diffeence,Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college  it was a wakeup call.,1863
1864,jealous,Judging by the :(  I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?,So all my friends went on vacation last week :(,1864
1865,jealous,I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D,Yeah  we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though  ha! So envious.,1865
1866,jealous,I hope where ever you go  you visit someplace amazing!,Sounds like a plan :),1866
1867,content,That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?,Man I am stuffed.  I found a new pizza joint in town.,1867
1868,content,You are lucky.,Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!,1868
1869,anxious,Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?,Man I couldn't get any sleep last night.,1869
1870,anxious,Hopefully you had a lock on them  you can never be too safe.,There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.,1870
1871,surprised,Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.,One year for our anniversary  an iPad showed up at my office. My boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary. I didn't expect it at all!,1871
1872,surprised,That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!,"He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it ""showering."" He's just good about knowing what I need!",1872
1873,joyful,I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?,I used to enjoy cold showers in the morining.,1873

1885,confident,Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly  once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. ,I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.,1885
1886,confident,I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't  maybe they aren't good employers.,It can be  but personality can't make up for incomptence either.,1886
1887,nostalgic,Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!,I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.,1887

1889,surprised,Yeah  it's like a small world.,It's very strange when you meet somebody you know  in the middle of a megalopolis. ,1889
1890,surprised,I think it is merely a coincidence.,Exactly  how does it even work?,1890
1891,sentimental,Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?,Small thing in life used to make me shed tears.,1891
1892,sentimental,Oh  I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry,Yes  things like great classical music for example. ,1892
1893,faithful,I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. ,We have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world. ,1893

1895,jealous,That's awesome!  What do they do?,Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.,1895
1896,jealous,That would be nice  but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.,They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.,1896
1897,afraid,That sucks. How fast were you driving?,Last week driving to work  I got pulled over for speeding.,1897
1898,afraid,I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit,Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.,1898
1899,ashamed,Oh man  I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow,I haven't drank beer in almost a year  but yesterday I relapsed. I feel like such a loser.,1899
1900,ashamed,Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans  we make mistakes. ,I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well  yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.,1900
1901,annoyed,That is probably so annoying,My neighbor is remodeling his house  which I hate  because they start at 5:30 in the morning.,1901
1902,annoyed,That really sucks. How long will it be going on?,I have a 3 year old  so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.,1902
1903,surprised,Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky  depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?,My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.,1903
1904,surprised,Well  then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck  and enjoy this time! :),Yeah  it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.,1904
1905,annoyed,Why not?,I went to see a movie last night. I wasn't really able to enjoy it though.,1905
1906,annoyed,Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.,There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.,1906
1907,apprehensive,I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? ,I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright  but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.,1907
1908,apprehensive,right  i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! ,I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.,1908

1947,disgusted,You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again,Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months  I think.,1947

1985,confident,I still could not do that  I am very weak human person.,It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs  hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.,1985

The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so,It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college. ,1989
1990,furious,Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.,My boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same. He claims he can't afford to pay me more  but I know that's not true.,1990

2008,disappointed,But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still , went for a job interview. I got the job offer but they offered me less money then I all ready make for more work.,2008
2009,disappointed,Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes,Not for the first few years. The title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a 20% downgrade. I can't take that loss.,2009
2010,anticipating,is there a special reason?,I'm so excited to go out to dinner tomorrow!,2010

2030,apprehensive,Just go for it! Never look back!,I'm about to start a new job  and I'm really nervous about it.,2030
2031,apprehensive,Best of luck my friend  you can do anything.,Okay  I'll take your advice! Wish me luck!,2031
2032,disgusted,I own an animal shelter here in my home town.,I get so mad when I watch shows about animal shelters and see how many people abuse animals.,2032
2033,disgusted,I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.,It must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times. Just watching a show makes me want to lash out.,2033

2275,afraid,That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?,I keep hearing noises coming from my basement...,2275
2276,afraid,If this were a movie  I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.,I want to  but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself  just in case.,2276
2277,disappointed,I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?,I can't believe this! My son failed a really important test.,2277

2286,furious,Oh  so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.,He wasn't to happy about me confronting him. I told him if it happens again it might get physical.,2286

2296,surprised,Well  it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.,I know! made it not so bad that the car I traded in was a junker and not worth much lol,2296
2297,prepared,How fun! In a tent or an RV?,I'm going camping with my kids this weekend.,2297
2298,prepared,Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!,In a tent. I just have to make extra sure that I pack all of the supplies that we'll need.,2298

2302,nostalgic,Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.,It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man  they really reminded me of my childhood.,2302
2303,terrified,That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? ,I keep getting strange phone calls. It's creeping me out.,2303
2304,terrified,Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. ,The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.,2304
2305,furious,Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?,My boyfriend told me he quit drinking  but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.,2305
2306,furious,Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.,Absolutely  but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.,2306
2307,excited,Congratulations  that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!,Yay! I'm finally getting a promotion at work!,2307
2308,excited,Hope you treat yourself to celebrate  you deserve it!,Yeah  a raise will definitely come with it. I've put a lot of work into this  and it finally paid off!,2308
2309,hopeful,That sounds amazing! When will you find out? ,So I might be up for a promotion soon at work!,2309

2325,impressed,About what?!,My coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today.,2325
2326,impressed,That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.,Oh it was just boring work stuff  about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.,2326
2327,disappointed,thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return ,I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months  but still no raise.,2327
2328,disappointed,Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! ,Yeah  especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!,2328

2336,lonely,If your depressed  speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change  that comes in time.,About two years now and everything still seems very odd to me.,2336
2337,embarrassed,Why is it that you are in trouble?,Uh oh. I'm in trouble now.,2337
2338,embarrassed,Can you just replace the document?,I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.,2338
2339,terrified,I would be reporting that to the police for sure. ,"There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters  and keeps calling on the phone ""just to chat"" with me.",2339
2340,terrified,Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. ,I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me  which is insane to me.,2340

2342,sad,I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.,Yes it was. It only took a few short months and my father passed away due to it being inoperable.,2342
2343,excited,That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?,I'm starting a new job next week! Can't wait to be doing something different for a change!,2343
2344,excited,Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place  you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.,Thanks! Graphic design mostly. At my old job I was a manager and it was horrible.,2344
2345,disappointed,Aw man  that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?,Recently  I got passed over for a promotion at my job.,2345
2346,disappointed,I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!,No  the guy that got it was qualified  it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.,2346

2354,content,Ah okay  nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast  so hold onto these moments while you can:),Well it's only a kiddie pool  kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.,2354
2355,guilty,Aw  well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.,As a child  I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.,2355
2356,guilty,Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.,True  but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today  but I never can take those things back.,2356
2357,surprised,I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?,my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift,2357
2358,surprised,That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.,he got my favorite flower  an orchid a card and made dinner ,2358
2359,embarrassed,Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. ,Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1 000 miles  and I felt like such a fool.,2359
2360,embarrassed,Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol ,Agreed  and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!,2360
2361,impressed,Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?,My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.,2361
2362,impressed,Well at least you managed to save him!,He is! Well  both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!,2362
2363,annoyed,Oh man  I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?,I've got a coworker with zero social skills  and it's driving me batty. She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.,2363
2364,annoyed,That's the worst! Some people  once they get started  they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.,If you make a comment on anything  say cats  she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).,2364
2365,embarrassed,Did it feel good to get it out?,We had an annoying client the other day  and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).,2365
2366,embarrassed,Oh no  that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?,It did at first  until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.,2366
2367,caring,That's heartbreaking  but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.,I found some baby kittens in my yard  their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.,2367
2368,caring,Yes  and when they love you it feels special  because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!,They are my favorite  too. I love how independent they are.,2368
2369,anxious,I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.,Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue  but I can't afford to pay them :(,2369
2370,anxious,Yeah  that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out  maybe it'll change.,I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks  and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.,2370
2371,confident,You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!,I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test,2371
2372,confident,Im glad it paid off for you  you must be super proud!,I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off ,2372
2373,devastated,Oh no  I am so sorry. What did you do?,A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me  I really loved that job.,2373
2374,devastated,That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?,To be honest  I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.,2374
2375,excited,Good  how long has it been since you saw them last?,im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night,2375
2376,excited,I hope you all have some fun.,about a year and a half!,2376
2377,anticipating,Oh yes  fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!,I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer  and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!,2377
2378,anticipating,It is the best season  by far! Plus  Halloween!,Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters  snuggling up with a hot drink  and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!,2378
2379,disgusted,Oh man  those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar  a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.,A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.,2379
2380,disgusted,Seriously  gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!,Thanks for the tip  I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!,2380
2381,hopeful,That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.,I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.,2381
2382,hopeful,It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.,Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages  but it's been stressful ever since.,2382
2383,surprised,oh that was nice of them,My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.,2383
2384,surprised,haha thats pretty fun,Yeah  they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.,2384
2385,afraid,Oh no  I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?,I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters  and I'm worried he won't live much longer.,2385
2386,afraid,Oh I see  I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!,Thank you  me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him  but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.,2386
2387,excited,That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!,I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!,2387
2388,excited,I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!,Yes  that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.,2388
2389,sad,That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?,im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick,2389
2390,sad,Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?,no they are at the vet now,2390
2391,disappointed,Oh no  what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!,Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day  great dinner  concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...,2391
2392,disappointed,Poor little thing  chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side  you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband  just not  you know  in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!,Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!,2392
2393,jealous,Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?,My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid  I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.,2393
2394,jealous,You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.,Well that's the thing  I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong  I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit. ,2394
2395,jealous,lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla  if you feel like it!,That is a really good way to put it  I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.,2395
2396,jealous,Exactly!,A Tesla with a bike rack!,2396
2397,joyful,oh thats nice,I'm happy my package just arrived,2397
2398,joyful,yea i would be to,im glad it came earlier,2398
2399,sentimental,Why's that?,I'm feeling nostalgic today,2399
2400,sentimental,Nostalgia is a weird feeling.,I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier,2400
2401,excited,Nice  what do you have planned?,I've got a fun weekend coming up  and I'm really looking forward to it!,2401
2402,excited,Sound great  I'm happy for you!,Going to the drive-in  out to eat  and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special  just haven't had fun in awhile!,2402
2403,proud,Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!,I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!,2403
2404,proud,Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.,It felt amazing to be recognized for my work  and in a publication I respect to boot! ,2404
2405,prepared,What are some things you will bring?,I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.,2405
2406,prepared,It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.,I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.,2406
2407,grateful,What is wrong? Are you okay?,Things have been rough for me lately  but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.,2407
2408,grateful,I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.,I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs  and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/,2408
2409,annoyed,We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.,the rain today is frustrating,2409
2410,annoyed,Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.,im not a fan of it at all,2410
2411,annoyed,Oh my goodness  I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!,The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign  nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.,2411
2412,annoyed,Ditto. It's not hard to do  and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!,I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.,2412
2413,surprised,Wow  congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?,My boyfriend proposed to me  and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.,2413
2414,surprised,Oh I feel you  I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.,Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year  but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!,2414
2415,guilty,I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.,I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time  but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!,2415
2416,guilty,Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.,No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too  and how could I say no to that?,2416
2417,content,Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.,i am pleased with the day im having today,2417
2418,content,That is true. It puts things in context.,me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad,2418
2419,proud,That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. ,Every night before bed  we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.,2419
2420,proud,It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. ,It is. And shows that he is listening. ,2420
2421,annoyed,that is frustrating  especially if the weather isnt ideal ,Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.,2421
2422,annoyed,that is unfortunate  im sorry that happened!,Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.,2422
2423,furious,That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?,My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.,2423
2424,furious,Are you going to get another cat?,I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.,2424
2425,joyful,I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!,I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.,2425
2426,joyful,I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!,Exactly! And the food  and friends. All of it is just so lovely.,2426
2427,grateful,That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.,Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.,2427
2428,grateful,That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.,Yes  I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.,2428
2429,surprised,8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!,I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.,2429
2430,surprised,Have you been a long time runner before that?,Yes  my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.,2430
2431,trusting,I can relate to that!  Yeah  my wife with my credit card  lol!,Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?,2431
2432,trusting,Haha  I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?,It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.,2432
2433,apprehensive,That's something that takes a lot of contemplation  because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?,"""I've been at my current job 5 years. I'm at the point I can go into upper management but I'm afraid. Maybe I'm just comfortable now. I don't know. ",2433
2434,apprehensive,Oh wow  an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.,An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA  I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. ,2434
2435,apprehensive,Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?,I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.,2435
2436,impressed,Oh wow  I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!,I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves  Color me impressed!,2436
2437,impressed,Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!,Yes   I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.,2437
2438,jealous,awesome! what kind?,A friend of mine bought a new car,2438
2439,jealous,oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat,Tesla  I've had my eye on the model for some time,2439
2440,impressed,That's good on his part  how do you feel about it?,A friend of mine got a new high paying job,2440
2441,impressed,That's awesome  and I agree  the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.,I thought it was amazing he got it  seemed like a tough job to land,2441
2442,annoyed,Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?,A co-worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project,2442
2443,annoyed,That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.,The guy just doesn't seem to care,2443
2444,ashamed,It will be okay. It's always hard making that step  but it's good for your health to do it.,Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit. ,2444
2445,ashamed,I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.,I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.,2445
2446,afraid,Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!,im scared of this big test tomorrow,2446
2447,afraid,Good luck  I'm sure you will do fine!,yes i have  still nervous though,2447
2448,guilty,Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. ,My wife and I are on a diet together for the last month. We have been doing great but today on my way home from work I stopped for Ice cream and did not tell her.,2448
2449,guilty,It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while  but you can't give in. Be strong!,Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow. ,2449
2450,afraid,You only get to do it once?,I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.,2450
2451,afraid,Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.,Yes  you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.,2451
2452,joyful,Congrats!,I finally got a raise at my job,2452
2453,joyful,Was it more than expected?,I was pretty happy  it was long overdue,2453
2454,embarrassed,That has happened to me  but with texts though lol,The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.,2454
2455,embarrassed,Did you apologize?,Yeah I've done that  too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.,2455
2456,embarrassed,LOL,No  when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!,2456
2457,apprehensive,what's wrong with it?,My car has been having issues lately,2457
2458,apprehensive,can you fix it?,Engine issues I think  not sure if the car will make it,2458
2459,surprised,That is great news. Have you also been working out?,Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.,2459
2460,surprised,Has it been easy or hard to do that?,Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.,2460
2461,guilty,did they notice it was missing?,I took some candy a friend left out,2461
2462,guilty,well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.,Not yet  I plan on compensating my friend for what I took,2462
2463,sad,Ohh wow! Are you excited?,I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years.,2463
2464,sad,Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though,No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.,2464
2465,terrified,That's very creepy  did he say anything to you?,The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.,2465
2466,terrified,Those are definitely the scary types  they don't recognize social cues at all.,Yeah that's what made it weird  it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.,2466
2467,anxious,Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.,A close friend said she was having problems with her knee,2467
2468,anxious,Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!,Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it,2468
2469,furious,I've never understood that  it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?,A co-worker stole my lunch,2469
2470,furious,Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag  maybe they will leave it alone.,Not entirely sure  I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs,2470
2471,furious,What did you do?,A friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret I told her in confidence to everyone. ,2471
2472,furious,You definitely can't be too careful these days,I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.,2472
2473,angry,how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?,Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day.,2473
2474,angry,ok,Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.,2474
2475,disgusted,Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality  and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.,I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.,2475
2476,disgusted,Yeah  I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one  and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy  mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So  we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.,It's funny you say that  I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy  which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.,2476
2477,confident,Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!,I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.,2477
2478,confident,Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. ,Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.,2478
2479,furious,What! First of all  are you alright?,Someone hit my car and fled the scene,2479
2480,furious,Oh  well that's something  at least. I can't believe people are such cowards  though.,Yeah  I'm fine  the car was parked,2480
2481,caring,That's great. Do they know?,'m promoting two staff members on Sunday. They work hard and are great people.,2481
2482,caring,Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either,They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me. ,2482
2483,anxious,I have never run a marathon,'m running my first Marathon Sunday. I'm scared that maybe I did not train hard enough.,2483
2484,anxious,You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one,No better time to try then now.,2484
2485,anxious,Well that's some sort of motivation lol,I will not run If I can't finish. I'm stubborn I'll finish or kill over.,2485
2486,proud,Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?,Just finished my Master's degree now time to take on a PhD,2486
2487,proud,Oh geeze  I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?,Astrophysics,2487
2488,anticipating,Have you tried to talk to your teacher?,I start my last year of my Masters program Friday. I'm scared I feel like I'm all ready behind.,2488
2489,anticipating,What school is this you are talking about?,No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known  it's one of the hardest schools to get into.,2489
2490,prepared,That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.,I spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis. I can't wait to get time to start.,2490
2491,prepared,Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you  I have over $40 000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!,I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor. ,2491
2492,jealous,I can understand that.,I love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn't I get sad and jealous. ,2492
2493,jealous,You must love him very much  that's good.,I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.,2493
2494,lonely,Aw  it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time,I'm at a new school and I won't have any friends,2494
2495,lonely,The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!,Yes  but how do I even talk to people I don't know?,2495
2496,hopeful,that is really nice of you to do  not a lot of people help others like that anymore,I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries,2496
2497,hopeful,same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help  i will most likely bring it to you,Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling,2497
2498,disappointed,Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more  or who has better connections  and not actual merit. If you're good  I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.,I can't believe I didn't get that promotion at work :(,2498
2499,disappointed,Well  keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job  hopefully that will be enough.,Agreed  it's a popularity contest!,2499
2500,furious,Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you ,My wife cheated on me! It's absurd!!,2500
2501,furious,I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds,Thank you  what should I do about it?,2501
2502,joyful,Did she say thank you?,I was very happy last week helping an elderly women bag her groceries ,2502
2503,joyful,What a lovely woman  and you're lovely  too!,Yes she did thank me ,2503
2504,angry,That's the worst! What did you do?,Ugh  my neighbor's dogs wouldn't stop barking this morning!,2504
2505,angry,That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!,Well I'll tell you what I didn't do. I didn't go back to sleep  due to the noise. I think I'm going to have a word with him later.,2505
2506,nostalgic,Yeah  those were better times. Brings back good memories.,Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it.,2506
2507,nostalgic,Well  maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.,Maybe we can relive such times through our children.,2507
2508,annoyed,Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?,I don't understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs I have a coworker like this.,2508
2509,annoyed,I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.,We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work. ,2509
2510,impressed,sounds like you ate a delicious dessert  what did you eat?,The desert was incredible! The taste! The look! The feel as I ate it!,2510
2511,impressed,that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert,It was chocolate ice cream dipped in crushed cookies  marshmallows  and chocolate sauce which had frozen to a crisp!,2511
2512,caring,O? That's a brave and noble decision.,I think I'm going to move my mother into my house with us.,2512
2513,caring,That's hard but great of you to do  good luck.,Yeah  she's been pretty sick lately. I want to make sure she's here where she can get all of the care that she needs.,2513
2514,anticipating,Where will you be shopping?,I'm going shopping tomorrow  it'll be so much fun!,2514
2515,anticipating,Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?,I think I'll go to Costco and Walmart.,2515
2516,disgusted,hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing,I'm so sad  my avocado was moldy this morning!,2516
2517,disgusted,did you still eat it? or did you throw it away,It really is! :(,2517
2518,surprised,That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them,My family is the best they through me a surprise birthday party.,2518
2519,surprised,Well  I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care,I was amazed they even did that but very grateful I haven't had anything in a while also so you wasn't alone your family will do something and you will enjoy it. ,2519
2520,surprised,Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?,i was shocked when i found out my wife cheated on me,2520

2911,angry,That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice  but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.,I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.,2911

2920,disgusted,Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place  EVER!!!!!!,Haha yes  I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.,2920
2921,disappointed,Very nice  congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?,I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company  two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.,2921
2922,disappointed,I would be upset too.  However  I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.,I had much more experience than both of them  but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.,2922

2933,ashamed,Oh  well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!,One time during Kindergarten  I peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom,2933

2935,impressed,Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?,One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up. ,2935

After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!,2936
2937,embarrassed,Thats... uh... strange?,The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.,2937
2938,embarrassed,I think so  you're two peas in a pod.,It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!,2938
2939,annoyed,Pets are great  but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great  but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.,I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!,2939
2940,annoyed,A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back  then you can get some work done.,Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.,2940

3050,annoyed,That's the worst  I hate when people are careless.,Due to a reckless driver running the red light  but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear. ,3050
3051,annoyed,I know what you mean,I get so angry when people stand me up it's so rude.,3051
3052,annoyed,that sucks. have you talked to her?,My coworker did this recent we was suppose to have lunch she didn't call or anything. ,3052
3053,anticipating,That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well  professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?,Professional settings is suppose to get along and be great but not my place of work staff fight like cats and dogs there. ,3053
3054,anticipating,I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building  communication  and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  ,We have a team building coming up and let's hope this works which I predict it will be some type of good outcome. ,3054
3055,prepared,Wow  you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?,I just drove 12 hours back from my parents' house. It wasn't so bad though  because I actually packed everything I needed for once. I was able to minimize the amount of stops I took and cut two hours off of the total time it took!,3055
3056,prepared,I see. Well  it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life,I work. We moved far from where they grew up when I was young  and they ended up moving back for retirement. ,3056
3057,sad,I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?,I was pretty bummed to find out that my favorite coworker is transferring to a different department.,3057
3058,sad,At least they aren't gone completely  but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.,Once in a while  here and there.,3058
3059,annoyed,i would be really annoyed myself  why so many frequent calls ?,I prequalified for a mortgage last week online. The bank I applied with has called me 3 times a day ever since. I'm getting pretty frustrated.,3059
3060,annoyed,i know ever since i purchased a new car  i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day   its really annoying ,I'm not sure. This is my first time shopping for a mortgage  so I'm not sure if it's normal or not.,3060
3061,impressed,I know right! my parents love tennis  so I grw up watching it.,I watched Wimbledon for the first time last summer. Those tennis players are SO GOOD!,3061
3062,impressed,were you ever any good at it?,I had played a little bit growing up  but never watched it professionally. ,3062
3063,nostalgic,Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?,It was so life-like and I have such fond memories of playing in there.  My stepdad worked for pillsbury and brought home dough and I would pretend I was baking.,3063
3064,nostalgic,Are you still in contact with him?,Yes somewhat  although with all that practice in childhood I should be much better.   I miss my stepdad so much.   I have nothing but fond memories of him.,3064
3065,disappointed,Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.,I looked at a house I really liked last week  but just found out it was taken off the market.,3065
3066,disappointed,I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.,Yeah  it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available.,3066
3067,prepared,That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?,I had to drive 12 hours straight last week. For once it wasn't terrible  because I packed everything I needed. Took two hours fewer than it normally does!,3067
3068,prepared,I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.,Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.,3068
3069,surprised,Was he alone?,I came home from work  expecting an empty apartment. My boyfriend was home from his trip a day early!,3069
3070,surprised,Cool. Did you do something special?,Yes  I was very excited to see him.,3070
3071,joyful,Congrats,I got a promotion at work! I'm so excited!,3071
3072,joyful,Do you get a raise?,Thank you!,3072
3073,annoyed,Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account,My bank has called me three times a day for the past week  and I'm tired of it.,3073
3074,annoyed,Are you interested in mortgage for now?,No  I prequalified for a mortgage  and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since.,3074
3075,disgusted,Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?,My roommate leaves her leftovers in the fridge for a disgusting amount of time.,3075
3076,disgusted,If you share the fridge  I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.,No  I don't feel like it's my place to tell her what to do.,3076
3077,surprised,cool. did he have gifts?,I came home expecting an empty apartment  but my boyfriend had come home a day early from his trip!,3077
3078,surprised,Oh. I am lol,No  but I'm not big on gifts.,3078
3079,guilty,Like what? Bad or miserable?,Do you feel anything like that,3079
3080,guilty,Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces,sad  when you see beggar in the street,3080
3081,anticipating,Wow. enjoy your own time.,Next month my wife and I are going on our first vacation  I can hardly wait.,3081
3082,anticipating,Yeah  you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation.,I will  it is going to be great to get away together.,3082
3083,furious,Wao thats really not cool,My ex boyfriend and I started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money.   After awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so I couldnt get in to see his messages.  THat was the first sign!,3083
3084,furious,He doesnt deserve you so wipe your tears,NO  not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.   ,3084
3085,lonely,That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too,I found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people I had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends.  I mostly met all of them through him when we got together  and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened.,3085
3086,lonely,Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though,I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .  I dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true.  I think they were just loyal to him.,3086
3087,angry,That's awesome  I wish I could build my own house.,I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me,3087
3088,angry,Well thank you as well.,Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.,3088
3089,sentimental,Did she die recently?,Her name was Lily and she was a pit bull  my favorite breed.   I loved her so much.  We did everything together.  She would go wherever I did.,3089
3090,sentimental,Oh wow! Thats so sad  I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry,No she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and I broke up.   I had no choice  and he did it just to hurt me.  Lily would go swimming with me  ride on our boat etc.  When she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler. ,3090
3091,anticipating,That can ruin a persons life.,He was originally suspended at 17 when he again got got with a little bit of weed.  They have a law here in missouri called 21 and under law.  Automatically get suspended for a year if ur a minor in possession.,3091
3092,anticipating,That is such a mess.,I know it can which is why I was so worried at court.  THe judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer.  I  throw people in jail for things like this.,3092
3093,proud,Tell me more  sounds exciting! ,The best thing happened at work today!,3093
3094,proud,Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work,Well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today I was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done.,3094

3096,anxious,What concert was it?,I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.,3096
3097,anxious,That probably would have been fun.,It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!,3097
3098,devastated,That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.,The aftermath was awful.  Trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless.  We lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us.,3098
3099,devastated,Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.,I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well.,3099
3100,furious,That is so messed up!,I ordered a new phone last week  and when the box got here it was empty.,3100
3101,furious,I would be so angry.,Yeah  I was pretty upset  especially when they initially refuse to refund my money.,3101
3102,sad,Oh wow  What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard,A few years back I had to bury my dog  who had died at the age of 13.,3102
3103,sad,I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day,He was a lab.  It broke my heart  to be honest.,3103
3104,proud,That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?,I thought I would never get the chance or opportunity to better my life as well as my childrens.  I cant wait till I get that degree,3104
3105,proud,That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference! ,I am getting a counseling degree to help abused women.  I feel I would make a good counselor since I  have been in a few abusive relationships myself.,3105
3106,nostalgic,Yeah? Which game was it for?,I saw a video game trailer recently that really brought me back!,3106
3107,nostalgic,Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.,The new Spyro Remastered game coming out. Seeing it really reminded me of how I used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine.,3107
3108,annoyed,Oh no. What did you do?,I had a flat on the way to work this morning  and the jack handle was missing from my car.,3108
3109,annoyed,Lol  well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?,I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked  lol.,3109
3110,surprised,That's great. What made it so special this year?,I just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual.,3110
3111,surprised,Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.,I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.,3111
3112,surprised,I am so happy for you! Congrats!,My wife and I have tried to have a baby for over three years  and had given up hope.  Two weeks ago  we found out she was pregnant.,3112
3113,surprised,I wish you nothing but the best!,Thank you!  We were both pretty shocked by the news  lol.,3113
3114,sentimental,It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.,I was in an extremely dangerous abusive relationship at the time and I knew he was intending to put her in the middle of it all.   He intended to use her for leverage over me .,3114
3115,sentimental,Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.,Oh my I am getting ahead of myself.  I was referring to when I had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in 2011.  ,3115
3116,annoyed,Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?,Ugh! My friend is definitely getting on my nerves today.,3116
3117,annoyed,Oh wow  so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too,We made plans to catch up but never set a time. I tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me. I was looking forward to catching up.,3117
3118,afraid,That sounds very bizarre.,Yes  I pray not to be found or trapped like they trapped me to stab unknown man.,3118
3119,afraid,I hope you are okay.,Serious  that has being my worse situation so far,3119
3120,angry,That is so messed up!,My car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning!,3120
3121,angry,I hope this doesn't happen again.,Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now.,3121
3122,embarrassed,Oh my  what did you do  may I ask?,I really felt like a fool last night.,3122
3123,embarrassed,That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!,I was playing a board game with a few friends and I ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table. ,3123
3124,anxious,Oh no  what happened?,Work was not a good experience today.,3124
3125,anxious,I hate public speaking too!,I had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people. I'm not a fan of talking in front of a crowd.,3125
3126,lonely,Dallas is a really fast city.,When i moved to dallas I felt I would have the time of my life after living in a small town  but after a couple of weeks i got homesick.,3126
3127,lonely,I'm sorry  things will get better.,yeah it is. I dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs. so I get to be at home by myself alot,3127

3131,guilty,I understand. My mistaske always happened.,Well not much. Its just I feel bad because I told her I would take her but got so busy. Maybe im the one that should have got the ticket. not her,3131
3132,grateful,Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track. ,Financial troubles are sometimes the worst! Ugh.,3132
3133,grateful,That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position. ,You really have to. Luckily  my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help.,3133
3134,anxious,You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?,so my brother will be the first out of 4 kids of my parents to have a baby and today is going to be the gender revealing party. ,3134
3135,anxious,Well  it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! ,we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is. everyone is so impatient about it  but today is the day.,3135
3136,content,Do you plan do something this weekend?,I'm looking forward to how chill this weekend will be.,3136
3137,content,Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.,Quite the opposite  really. I just paid all my bills and have not really any plans. Sometimes it's nice to just not have that stress and relax.,3137
3138,apprehensive,That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?,So this year will be the first time I been to a haunted house. Im get scared easilty so Im kinda worried. I promised my friend I would go with her. ,3138
3139,apprehensive,Well  if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine. ,I dont know  but I feel I should not go  but again I promised my friend I would go. I dont know wha to do now. ,3139
3140,confident,Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.,Me and this girl have been dating for awhile now so I think Im going to ask her to be my girlfriend. ,3140
3141,confident,I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.,Yes I agree. I feel that way about it. You know me too well. ,3141
3142,sad,That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more. ,My sister's cat got sick and had to be put down last week. Feels bad.,3142
3143,sad,I agree  just remember her for all the good memories. ,She had stomach cancer  so she was in a lot of pain. Definitely the right thing to do,3143
3144,prepared,Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?,I have a huge exam coming up tomorrow.,3144
3145,prepared,What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety. ,It's for a PC Architecture class. I'm feeling really good about it though since I studied really hard all week!,3145
3146,disgusted,That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?,There are maggots all over my building's garbage bin this morning. I got one on my arm when I walked by,3146
3147,disgusted,I understand. The best thing is to move.,They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!,3147
3148,terrified,That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining,Coming home driving in the rain my car hydroplaned on the freeway!,3148
3149,terrified,You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be,I agree and thank god I was the only car on the freeway   otherwise It would be a different story!,3149
3150,surprised,Really  where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday,I'm amazed on how many people came to the parade considering the rain!,3150
3151,surprised,I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!,I'm here down south and It has been pouring as well  but that didnt stop people from coming! Im shocked. ,3151
3152,sentimental,oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat,I just saw a commercial about the Rescue Animals. Everytime I see it it makes me so sad. ,3152

3158,excited,I hope you guys have the best time!,Yes she is. We are all so excited to finally hang out! We have so much planned,3158
3159,jealous,That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?,So the role I worked so hard for went to a person who could care less about the play! ,3159
3160,jealous,I hate it when stuff like that happens. ,I guess you can say that! What a day!,3160
3161,jealous,Haha  nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.,I agree. Maybe I will act like him next time. ,3161
3162,jealous,Sounds like the best course to me :),Yeah your right. I will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day,3162

3168,guilty,Did it taste good?,It was really good! She had a lot of candy. I was hoping she wouldn't notice some missing!,3168
3169,impressed,Were you suprised that they did this for you?,two weeks back i celebrated my birthday and do you know what my office colleagues planed for me,3169
3170,impressed,Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement. ,yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me,3170
3171,impressed,You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work,yes it took me with a surprise how well my colleagues planned for me,3171

3173,sad,it must must a very much hard time for you and your family ,He died of old age. He could barely walk so they put him down. Yeah pretty bad news. It made my day blue,3173
3174,sad,yes   he be rest in peace,Yes it is. He is in a better place now. ,3174
3175,afraid,I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?,We went camping in the mountain. We did not know it was bear season. There were a lot of hunters and hunting dogs in the area. They were chasing the bears into one area,3175
3176,afraid,Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.,Luckily  the hunters kept them around a mile from camp. It was still very hard to sleep! We heard dogs barking at the bears all night!,3176
3177,afraid,Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.,We were in a tent and all of food was in a Yeti! I made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire.,3177
3178,devastated,Oh  I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family. ,We had a doberman for over 8 years. He passed away last spring. It was a hard time for our family.,3178
3179,devastated,You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. ,They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs.,3179
3180,disgusted,That's disgusting. What did you do about it?,last week i visited a restaurant and found a insect in the burger which i ordered,3180
3181,disgusted,Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!,i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager,3181
3182,anxious,That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.,We have homeschooled our daughter for the past 3 years. This year  she has decided to return to public school.,3182
3183,anxious,Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.,She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!,3183
3184,excited,Wow good job! SO close,This will be my last semester in college! I cant wait to finish.,3184

3186,lonely,maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group,Since I moved to dallas I have not met any friends. I go to work and school and just come home. ,3186
3187,lonely,i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump,I agree. It gets boring at home alone with no one. ,3187
3188,lonely,that should be fun. good luck!,I agree. This weekend it is! ,3188
3189,disappointed,Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?,My sister lives in Utah. We had planned for her to come visit but her work would not allow her to take the time off.,3189
3190,disappointed,I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly  but it will in the end,I haven't yet. I would like to eventually. I'm hoping to see her soon,3190
3191,trusting,Did he take care of it for you?,So I was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car. I was hesitant at first  but I felt he would do good with it and take care of it. ,3191
3192,trusting,That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud. ,He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this. ,3192
3193,grateful,That's awesome  what does your hubster do?,My husband works very hard so that I can be a stay at home mom. It has allowed me the freedom to homeschool our daughter.,3193

3195,anticipating,Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature  it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated,So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard. ,3195
3196,anticipating,Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them,I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for. ,3196
3197,furious,Oh no  do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?,My child sneaked in my room to get the Xbox controller while I was sleeping. The night before  I had grounded her.,3197
3198,furious,I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.,I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.,3198
3199,disgusted,Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?,My friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere. ,3199
3200,disgusted,Man  you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!,Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok. ,3200
3201,sentimental,So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity,My friends mother got diagnosed with cancer last month and its been hard on her. ,3201
3202,sentimental,Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for,Yeah. Shes my best friend  so I'm planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom. my heart breaks for her..,3202
3203,embarrassed,oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though  we all do that sometimes,Last week I did a presentation at work and as I stood up I blew some gas!,3203
3204,embarrassed,oh man... It happened to me before  i know how embarrassing it is.,Yes it was loud. I can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!,3204
3205,impressed,That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?,So my little brother barely passed his finals to become a cop! I could not beleive it. ,3205
3206,impressed,Well at least he passed - that's great!,Im very happy  but all he do through school was party and never study. Im shocked. ,3206
3207,proud,That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.,We went to the library where they had an animal expert stop by for the kids. My daughter was able to answer most of his questions that other kids could not. It made me smile.,3207
3208,proud,I will do that  i had no idea.,You should check your local library. The ones in my area have tons of things  like a Lego club  for the local kids.,3208
3209,devastated,I'm really sorry to hear that.,My dad died of cancer in 2012. That was really hard for me emotionally.,3209
3210,devastated,I can't even imagine to be honest.,Thank you. I was prepared  but it was still difficult.,3210
3211,devastated,I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.,I hope you don't have to go through it for a long time.,3211
3212,devastated,I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.,It's always tough  even if someone is older.,3212
3213,hopeful,that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?,I have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks.,3213
3214,hopeful,You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig,I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager!,3214
3215,trusting,you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance,I just hired a new hotel inspector  he has very little experience but wants to learn. Scares me.,3215
3216,trusting,i hope it won't happen! ,Yes  I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.,3216
3217,embarrassed,Oh no! Did he say anything about it?,In high school  I fell down the stairs in front of my crush. My face turned red and I ran away!,3217
3218,embarrassed,I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly  don't you!,He laughed at me. Looking back  I'm sure it was funny but in the moment  I could have died!,3218
3219,joyful,Awesome! What are you planning on buying?,Last night I won a gift card at Trivia night at the pub. Going shopping today.,3219
3220,joyful,Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!,I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.,3220
3221,furious,Oh no that is crazy!,I found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married  we were together for 7 years at that point. Today I'm stressed!,3221
3222,furious,Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. ,Yea  We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.,3222
3223,surprised,I hate those things  i try to not eat those at all.,I woke up one morning to make a sandwich. The smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! I felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store. I purchased a pregnancy test.,3223
3224,surprised,I eat steak and shrimp.,I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!,3224
3225,annoyed,i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.,I have a friend that will not stop talking about himself. He always wants to talk about his latest investments  the books he has read  and how much he knows about the places that he visits!,3225
3226,annoyed,i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?,I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.,3226
3227,annoyed,agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.,Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.,3227
3228,excited,I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!,I am a big Taylor Swift friend! ,3228
3229,excited,How exciting for you! Have fun!,Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!,3229
3230,anxious,You have a test coming up?,I know I studied well  but I can't stop worrying about it. ,3230
3231,anxious,Well I hope you do well! Good luck.,Yes on Friday. It is the final.,3231
3232,joyful,That's interesting. What was she doing?,She had a lot  of friends that came.,3232
3233,joyful,That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business. ,She had her birthday at Chuck E Cheese.,3233
3234,annoyed,Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.,I love to coupon but sometimes I feel like the cashiers aren't trained properly. They will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print.,3234
3235,annoyed,I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it,I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!,3235
3236,angry,Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.,The cop said he was too old!,3236
3237,angry,That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.,Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving! ,3237
3238,guilty,Oh no  he shouldn't have gambled. ,I played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing. I won about $100 from him that night.,3238
3239,guilty,I would've too  but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.,You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.,3239
3240,afraid,Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?,Recently there have been a few break ins.,3240
3241,afraid,For real! Are you taking any precautions?,No  my neighbor did but that's close enough for me! ,3241
3242,sad,Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?,One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food,3242
3243,sad,Okay  that makes more sense then to me.,It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant,3243
3244,prepared,Where are you located ?,We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.,3244
3245,prepared,I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.,We are in Miami  Florida 1 mile from the beach. .,3245
3246,furious,Who did what?,The cop said I will probably never find out who did it. ,3246
3247,furious,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!,I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.,3247
3248,apprehensive,Oh no! Why not?!,My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners. ,3248
3249,apprehensive,I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!,Not  sure  but she is not very nice at all.,3249
3250,angry,Never know who was?,I may never know who she was.,3250
3251,angry,Wow that is aweful! ,The women that hit my car and left before the police came.,3251
3252,afraid,Oh wow  what happened?,Near my house  there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager  a group of friends and I decided to go check it out.,3252
3253,afraid,That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?,When we pulled up  it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!,3253
3254,afraid,I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!,There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!,3254
3255,confident,Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.,My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December  I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair.,3255
3256,confident,Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!,That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!,3256
3257,nostalgic,That's awesome  I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month  it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?,I recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair  it felt so nice reliving my childhood.,3257
3258,nostalgic,Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair  was always fun.,It was great  it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.,3258
3259,jealous,You must have been sad and angry.,When I was in high school  I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer  he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.,3259
3260,jealous,Yes first heart brake is so hard  I feel for you  something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.,I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.,3260
3261,surprised,That's awesome! Congratulations!,This was my first time winning a contest on the raido!,3261
3262,surprised,No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun,Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight! ,3262
3263,guilty,Ouch  hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.,I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.,3263
3264,guilty,I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha  its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.,I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.,3264
3265,furious,Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.,I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.,3265
3266,furious,I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! ,Yeah we tried but he cut all communication  he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness. ,3266
3267,afraid,Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.,So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM  and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.,3267
3268,afraid,Well  at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.,Yeah it was quite an experience  my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!,3268
3269,sad,Oh no! That's sad  did he get them all?,I raised 6 chickens since they were babies. I was trying to let them free range but I forgot to put them back in their coop for the night. A predator was able to get to them.,3269
3270,sad,Aw  that's too bad  hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!,Yes  it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.,3270
3271,surprised,wow  so what are you going to do with it?,I was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found $40 in one of the back pockets. Made me very happy lol,3271
3272,surprised,nice  i hope that works out for you... good luck,Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have  trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!,3272
3273,disgusted,That is gross  I can't even imagine what that would taste like!,I was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean. Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.,3273
3274,disgusted,That's so gross  I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.,He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.,3274
3275,impressed,Omg  Thankfully he wasn't hurt. ,One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it  it was like 10+ feet of distance  really amazing stuff.,3275
3276,impressed,Did yall happen to get it on video? ,Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.,3276
3277,excited,Congrats!  I'm sure you must be very happy!,My older brother is getting married Friday.,3277
3278,excited,Haha brotherly love  I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!,I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!,3278
3279,joyful,thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day,Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.,3279
3280,joyful,i bet so!,It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.,3280
3281,anxious,Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?,im nervous for the new week to begin,3281
3282,anxious,That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! ,very busy and lots of traveling,3282
3283,embarrassed,We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!,I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha,3283
3284,embarrassed,Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.,Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!,3284
3285,guilty,Did you not want to go out  or did you just not like the movie?,I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.,3285
3286,guilty,Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress  it may be the stress talking and not you.,I was tired and wanted to get in bed early ,3286
3287,prepared,Great  when will you know your scores?,Had my finals last week  studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm,3287
3288,prepared,Wow  that's fantastic.,Thankfully i knew them right at the spot  i got a 98!,3288
3289,jealous,Who doesn't?,He doesn;t seem to see the issue.,3289
3290,jealous,What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!,My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem. ,3290
3291,disappointed,That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?,I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.,3291
3292,disappointed,Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.,Yeah  passed with a 75  not what i wanted but at least i passed,3292
3293,embarrassed,Oh no  how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).,i dropped my groceries in the parking lot,3293
3294,embarrassed,Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once  which rolled under the car. I was livid!,i grabbed the cans that rolled away  lol,3294
3295,angry,That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.,One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each,3295
3296,angry,Well  I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows  how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?,Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy  worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.,3296
3297,annoyed,That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.,"A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had ""call ahead seating"" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later  our table was not ready!",3297
3298,annoyed,Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.,That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.,3298
3299,furious,Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time  but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.,We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home  the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!,3299
3300,furious,Yeah  that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it  but on that day I wouldn't be so sure  haha.,They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.,3300
3301,afraid,That is a huge blessing  I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.,I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.,3301
3302,afraid,It's almost a shame how much we depend on them  but I know I'd be lost without mine.,Same here  they're so incredibly important in this day and age.,3302
3303,annoyed,Do they run them all day long - or at night?,i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door,3303
3304,annoyed,Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm  there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.,during the morning and day on the weekends!,3304
3305,apprehensive,I don't blame  you because I hate camping.,My best friends invited me to a camping trip but I was a little anxious about the whole thing.,3305
3306,apprehensive,Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.,Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!,3306
3307,impressed,What happened?,i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend,3307
3308,impressed,You are lucky to have such great friends!,they were very supportive and kind   helping me with some moving things,3308
3309,terrified,oh that sucks  i hope it has healed since then,A few weeks ago I was drinking with some friends at a park and I sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two.,3309
3310,terrified,ouch  that sounds awful,It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.,3310
3311,surprised,How come? Have you had awful weather lately?,i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning,3311
3312,surprised,Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!,not really but it was just especially nice this morning,3312
3313,sad,Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!,I decided to move to be with my boyfriend.,3313
3314,sad,Aw  but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life  after all,I did  but I had to leave all my family behind,3314
3315,angry,Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?,im mad at my neighbor today,3315
3316,angry,How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.,he was using powertools loud in the morning,3316
3317,joyful,thats awesome  i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them,Last Christmas  I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.,3317
3318,joyful,me too!,Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.,3318
3319,proud,I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.,The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job  I had to learn it all on my own.,3319
3320,proud,Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.,Same here. Surprisingly  I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!,3320
3321,joyful,That's always a great start to a day.,i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm,3321
3322,joyful,How are you celebrating it?,absolutely  i was overjoyed,3322
3323,confident,Oh wow. What's the exam on?,I have a big exam coming up tomorrow.,3323
3324,confident,That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.,It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.,3324
3325,terrified,Oh no  what happened?,On my way back from a funeral  my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.,3325
3326,terrified,Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.,I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere  he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.,3326
3327,excited,Congratulations! Retail really does suck.,I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.,3327
3328,excited,Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.,Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.,3328
3329,nostalgic,Oh  all the time. What album is that for you?,Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?,3329
3330,nostalgic,I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.,I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.,3330
3331,angry,That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?,A while back  my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.,3331
3332,angry,I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.,No idea. All I know is that I was furious  especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.,3332
3333,anxious,I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?,Last night was quite a bummer.,3333
3334,anxious,That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.,I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.,3334
3335,content,That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?,After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands  today is my first day off in a while.,3335
3336,content,Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.,It is  I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch  it couldn't get any better than this!,3336
3337,disappointed,That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.,My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.,3337
3338,disappointed,I hope he doesn't let you down.,I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together  but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.,3338
3339,impressed,Something good happen to him recently?,I'm so happy for my brother!,3339
3340,impressed,That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.,He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.,3340
3341,sad,Oh no  that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!,My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.,3341
3342,sad,Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.,French is a really hard language  I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.,3342
3343,terrified,That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?,My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.,3343
3344,terrified,I bet. I would've hid under the table.,Some things got broke and there were some bruises  but it was really scary to watch that.,3344
3345,proud,That's nice. Why do you say that?,i am blessed to have a great family,3345
3346,proud,That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.,they're just the best and always very helpful,3346
3347,annoyed,That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?,Whenever my sister in law plans things  she only does it around her schedule.,3347
3348,annoyed,Well  at least that's the case. People can only do so much.,Yeah  but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However  we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.,3348
3349,lonely,Oh yeah? Why is that?,This weekend was kind of a drag.,3349
3350,lonely,Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?,I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.,3350
3351,nostalgic,Are the good memories at least?,The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.,3351
3352,nostalgic,At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!,Oh yeah  but it really makes me miss those times.,3352
3353,nostalgic,Which one?,I'm looking forward to this new game.,3353
3354,nostalgic,I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?,The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine. ,3354
3355,guilty,That's rough. Why can't you help her?,I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one  I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore.,3355
3356,guilty,Yeah  I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.,I just have too much going on now with two kids  and working from home.,3356
3357,impressed,How long did it take them?,I saw some person eat like 30 hamburgers in Mcdonalds,3357
3358,impressed,He must of been sick after.,I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast  so like 10 minutes,3358
3359,prepared,That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time,One time I bought emergency supplies before a hurricane,3359
3360,prepared,Wow  thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal,Yup  people started charging like $5 per bottle of water,3360
3361,disappointed,What was the news?,I just got some frustrating news the other day.,3361
3362,disappointed,Are you going to ground him?,My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.,3362

3364,jealous,Why don't you get another job?,We definitely don't have money for that  plus there are four of us.,3364
3365,sad,That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?,Ugh. I got some awful news the other day.,3365
3366,sad,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.,I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming. ,3366
3367,afraid,Holy cow.  Was anything missing?,Hi there was a time that I was scared out of my mind I came home and my front door was unlocked and the lights were on in the house,3367

3372,excited,That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck,We are going to Hawaii for a whole week. We have saved a long time to be able to afford this  I can barely wait till next month.,3372
3373,sentimental,I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?,Do you feel when you see your mom after a long time,3373
3374,sentimental,I'm sorry  but I can't understand what you're saying.,Why! what is the reason,3374
3375,devastated,Oh man! I have been there  I hope you didn't have anything special down there??,Last year  during the spring  extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded.,3375
3376,devastated,Oh lord  i am so sorry! I have been there  that is hard!,I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved  my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items.,3376

3383,sad,oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?,I saw a deer get hit by a car yesterday.,3383
3384,sad,yea you never like to see stuff like that.,It wasn't dead  It was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road. it was upsetting.,3384
3385,surprised,did you try to find its owner?,I opened up my mailbox this morning and there was a 10 dollar bill just sitting there inside!,3385
3386,surprised,well that was nice of someone,I asked my neighbors about it  no one knew anything about it. I guess it was left there intentionally.,3386
3387,annoyed,That's annoying  are you going to talk to them about it?,A co-worker I've been working on a project with has been late,3387
3388,annoyed,I hope it all works out in the end.,I plan on doing that  it's pretty disruptive,3388
3389,hopeful,Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?,I just finished a major project at work for a client,3389
3390,hopeful,I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!,Not at the moment  but I'm praying my supervisor and client likes it,3390
3391,afraid,What is the appointment for?,I have an appointment for tomorrow. I'm hoping the same thing.,3391
3392,afraid,Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.,My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week  I think there might be something really wrong.,3392
3393,afraid,You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.,Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon.,3393
3394,afraid,I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.,5,3394
3395,annoyed,Oh man  sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first  but getting to bed early will help with her future.,My child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school. Last night  I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am.,3395
3396,annoyed,Well yea  they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.,I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.,3396
3397,jealous,that is so lucky  they must be so happy they bought that ticket,A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100 000 on the pick 6 last week.,3397
3398,jealous,i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha,They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them  and I said no. I regret that now  I could have really used a share of that money.,3398
3399,confident,What kind of test is it,I studied really had so I am sure I will pass my test!,3399
3400,confident,Oh I hope you do well then,It was my science final for college. ,3400
3401,jealous,wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long,My friend went on a 14 day cruise to Europe. I wish that could have been me! ,3401
3402,jealous,yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say,Right? Talk about ultimate relaxation!,3402
3403,anticipating,that is really nice of him  how much time will you have to wait?,My son is supposed to be sending me some money...,3403

3405,afraid,that is horrible  natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them,I am scared of another hurricane coming through Florida. I had a bad experience last year.,3405
3406,afraid,not really  the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm,No  all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters? ,3406
3407,content,I bet that was a wonderful day,When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life.,3407
3408,content,I am very happy for you,It really was  my life finally felt complete.,3408
3409,disappointed,that is not good  have you expressed your feelings to your boss?,I got passed over for a promotion at work last week  even thought I had more experience than the other applicants.,3409
3410,disappointed,well i hope everything goes well for you  you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry,I did  and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.,3410
3411,apprehensive,It's a whole new world when that happens  I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?,I remember when I started my first office job out of college. I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect.,3411
3412,apprehensive,It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.,I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day  but I soon got used to it.,3412
3413,disgusted,Oh no  that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?,I found some mold growing out in the garage,3413
3414,disgusted,May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.,I ended up cleaning it myself  I think I got most of it out,3414
3415,excited,what is that?,I was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up Rodimus after all that waiting!  I've never been so excited in my life.  ,3415
3416,excited,oh that explains it!,It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha,3416
3417,angry,Wow when the child just asked?!,I saw a child ask for a candy bar that the grocery store yesterday. The mother spanked the child in front over every one in the line!,3417
3418,angry,I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.,Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!,3418
3419,angry,OMG that's so gross! ,One time I saw someone's dog pooping in my lawn and they didn't pick it up!,3419
3420,angry,That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way  after all. ,Yes  I wanted to throw it back at them!,3420
3421,embarrassed,Oh god. That's kinda gross.,I used the bathroom at Walmart the other day. I walked around the store for about 30 minutes before I realized I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe!!!,3421
3422,embarrassed,Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.,I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.,3422
3423,annoyed,Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?,My son just started a new school.  The communication with them has been terrible!,3423
3424,annoyed,That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!,I sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!,3424
3425,terrified,Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada  who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?,We went to the lagoon a few weeks ago. My friends dared me to jump off of the highest cliff into the water.,3425
3426,terrified,You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast! ,That was what I was worried about! I ended up not jumping off of the highest one. I was too scared. I did jump off of the smallest one. That was really fun!,3426
3427,confident,Do you feel ready for it?,I have a test coming up in one of my classes this week.,3427
3428,confident,Awesome  hope it goes as planned!,Oh yeah  I'm definitely ready. I know I'm going to pass.,3428
3429,surprised,Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?,I had about 6 or 7 hummingbirds in my yard the other day feeding.,3429
3430,surprised,Awww...that's a bit disappointing  but really cool that you got to see them!,No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures  they are so small.,3430
3431,disappointed,The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.,I was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market  but someone put in a bid before I got a chance and it has already sold.,3431
3432,disappointed,That would have been awesome if you got it.,It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on  I would have really liked to have owned it.,3432
3433,prepared,That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.,I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of.,3433
3434,prepared,Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking  so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.,You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!,3434
3435,trusting,What did they do to you?,I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.,3435
3436,trusting,It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.,They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.,3436
3437,disappointed,I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! ,I worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables. We've practiced and practiced and she still doesn't know them all!,3437
3438,disappointed,That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha,We homeschool too! I hope she can get them soon! It will make this year's math so much easier!,3438
3439,prepared,Do you hike very often?,I'm going on a hiking trip soon,3439
3440,prepared,I've never been hiking  really! I'd like to go some day.,Here and there when I have time,3440
3441,excited,Oh  such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!,I scrapbook pictures of my son and I am a few years behind!,3441
3442,excited,Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.,My son just started school all day  so I plan to start scrapbooking.  I don't use Stamp It Up though.,3442
3443,sad,So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.,This past weekend  my cat Sam passed away  he was 17 years old.,3443
3444,sad,May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.,Yeah it's been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while I work.,3444
3445,content,That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.,I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.,3445
3446,content,Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!  ,No point in being a pessimist.,3446
3447,proud,Mmm  now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?,I baked a cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out to be so delicious! He was so excited. ,3447
3448,proud,Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet  but black forest is amazing too!,Black forest cake! It happens to be both our favorite kind of cake. I made it from scratch. What's your favorite cake? ,3448
3449,guilty,Aww  I know that can be hard  but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.,I felt so bad when I had to board my dog while I was on vacation. It made me feel like a bad dog mom! ,3449
3450,guilty,Absence makes the heart grow fonder.,I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better. ,3450
3451,proud,What are some of your best traits?,I'm happy with the person that I grew up to be.,3451
3452,proud,Do you exercise often?,I'm healthy!,3452
3453,joyful,Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha  and even if you did  dogs are worth it.,So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!,3453
3454,joyful,Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way  I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.,No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy,3454
3455,nostalgic,I've never been  but it looks like so much fun.,I love going to Disney World. It makes me remember all the wonderful memories I made there as a child.,3455
3456,nostalgic,It would be so much fun to go there as a family.,It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet  but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday. ,3456
3457,embarrassed,Oh yeah I am right there with you  I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2,Sometimes when I am out in public  my son throws a tantrum.,3457
3458,embarrassed,They are too smart for their own good,Mine is 5.  Every now and then  he says a curse word  uses it properly too!,3458
3459,disgusted,what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread,I was just about to make a sandwich to eat  when I discovered something really gross.,3459
3460,disgusted,ewwww  so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it,No  there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.,3460
3461,annoyed,or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks,The head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker. I feel like she's just lazy and making us do her job.,3461
3462,annoyed,did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel,Ha  that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.,3462
3463,furious,Did you call the police?,I can't believe this!  Some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!,3463
3464,furious,Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty,No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.  ,3464
3465,proud,That's great! I'm so happy for you!,Guess what!  I nailed my review for this year and got a raise!,3465
3466,proud,Ooh  will you be managing anyone?,Thank you! I worked so hard and I am so freaking excited!  I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!,3466
3467,angry,I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?,I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning,3467
3468,angry,Ugh! Were you away from home?,Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!,3468
3469,proud,Oh wow  she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you  but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.,My stepdaughter graduated from college in May and got a job in San Francisco making 3 times more than I have ever made.,3469
3470,proud,Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her  I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!,I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.,3470
3471,content,That is a good feeling!,Whew. I finally got all of my work done for the day.,3471
3472,content,Nice! No kids at home?,It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.,3472
3473,anxious,Are you afraid of the dentist?,I am so nervous.  I have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced. ,3473
3474,anxious,I'm sorry to hear that  I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck  I'm sure everything will be just fine.,I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.,3474
3475,confident,Oh nice! That's super brave of you.,I spoke at a conference recently. I was a little scared going into it but felt great as I knew I knew my speech.,3475
3476,confident,That's a great skill to have!,I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking. ,3476
3477,nostalgic,That must have been a nice feeling. ,I was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums. I spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time.,3477
3478,nostalgic,I love that nostalgic feeling. ,It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos  made me really smile to see their faces again.,3478
3479,annoyed,Haha  sounds like my pupper  is she still young?,I am so irritated.  My dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where I put them!,3479
3480,annoyed,Right!? It's weird  you buy them all the toys in the world  but they still go after your stuff.,Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...,3480
3481,lonely,Why he is working late?,My husband works late at night and sometimes I'm stuck by myself.,3481
3482,lonely,I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?,He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong  he is forced to stay to fix the issue.,3482
3483,jealous,Aww man that sucks for you ,My aunt just signed for my cousin to get an FJ Cruiser! That is my dream car! He doesn't even have a job.,3483
3484,jealous,Hopefully! It is your dream car after all,It does! Maybe he will at least let me drive it!,3484
3485,excited,That should be fun. Any big planes?,I'm looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend,3485
3486,excited,That will be nice to catch up.,Nothing too big  probably just wander around town,3486
3487,angry,That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!,I'm so irritated at my neighbor. She moved out recently and left ALL her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage.,3487
3488,angry,I wonder what could have changed? Either way  I'd be pretty pissed off.,Not at all  that's what is so weird! She was really polite  quiet  and neat.,3488
3489,grateful,Oh no! That is terrible!,Last week the plant I work at was hit with massive layoffs. ,3489
3490,grateful,I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!,I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job  I am happy but very sad for the others.,3490
3491,lonely,How do you feel these days?,Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself.,3491
3492,lonely,It must be difficult  do you think she will come back ever?,It has gotten a little better with time  but still a pretty sore spot for me.,3492
3493,anxious,Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?,I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.,3493
3494,anxious,Wow! That's like a paid vacation!,Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company  no less. So everything worked out!,3494
3495,jealous,Wow  that's incredible. What's their secret? ,Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.,3495
3496,jealous,Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!,Right place  right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.,3496
3497,caring,That's unfortunate  hope you don't get it as well!,My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around,3497
3498,caring,I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. ,I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.,3498
3499,surprised,Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?,"My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message ""from myself "" it was the person who found it saying ""I have your phone.""",3499
3500,surprised,You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.,I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.,3500
3501,impressed,Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?,I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated  just out of curiosity.,3501
3502,impressed,Next time they let you in  just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.,Nah  although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.,3502
3503,nostalgic,Yeah  they are cute like that. How old is she ?,My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.,3503
3504,nostalgic,I have a 10 year old like that.,She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.,3504
3505,impressed,that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding,My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!,3505
3506,impressed,that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.,It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!,3506
3507,impressed,you are very welcome. good luck!,thank you!,3507
3508,annoyed,That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!,My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.,3508
3509,annoyed,Yeah  It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. ,I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?,3509
3510,devastated,I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February  so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?,We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.,3510
3511,devastated,I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing  so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped  something to think about at least.,It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter,3511
3512,trusting,I am sure she will be smart with it,I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.,3512
3513,trusting,You can always show her the ways,I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone,3513
3514,ashamed,Were they okay?,I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.,3514
3515,ashamed,At least you're not getting sued,Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.,3515
3516,ashamed,Im good at that lol,Oh man  that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!,3516
3517,terrified,Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.,I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.,3517
3518,terrified,I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.,This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared,3518
3519,afraid,I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?,We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!,3519
3520,afraid,I am not sure I would do well in that house,Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up  it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.,3520
3521,sentimental,Bet that brought back good memories.,After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage  listening to those was pretty cool.,3521
3522,sentimental,Where did you guys usually go?,Definitely  brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.,3522
3523,prepared,whats the competition on ?,I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.,3523
3524,prepared,Nice hope you win   ill be looking into this further ,Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.,3524
3525,angry,I wonder how that was noted on your report.,I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG ,3525
3526,angry,Sounds like a wacky place to work.,I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. ,3526
3527,proud,That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.,I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.,3527
3528,proud,Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.,Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!,3528
3529,afraid,Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?,For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.,3529
3530,afraid,I hope it's not a crazy person or worse  an alien waiting to abduct you!,I don't think so  it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.,3530
3531,angry,Its so hard to monitor that stuff now,I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!,3531
3532,angry,Yeah  that is a scary thing to think about too,It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.,3532
3533,annoyed,On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?,I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what  he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.,3533
3534,annoyed,Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.,No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!,3534
3535,furious,No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.,My neighbor stole a package from me.,3535
3536,furious,Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.,So check this out  I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it  the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!,3536
3537,lonely,you havent met all three people in the city yet?,I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone. ,3537

3539,jealous,What kind of job was it,My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.,3539
3540,jealous,Sales do sound hard to do,Sales  so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.,3540
3541,caring,Is he going to be okay,My cat got sick the other day  he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.,3541
3542,caring,I am glad then  I hate to see pets in pain,Yes  thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.,3542
3543,impressed,That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.,My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!,3543
3544,impressed,Hahahaha  it's hard to compare yourself with that  but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.,Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha,3544
3545,guilty,Why? Were they not working?,I think I got my coworker in trouble.,3545
3546,guilty,He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.,He called in sick  but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick  I thought he was just out. So  I accidentally told my boss where he was.,3546
3547,guilty,Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?,Thanks  that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!,3547
3548,anticipating,That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?,Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.,3548

3557,hopeful,lol why do you have to steer clear?,I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.,3557
3558,hopeful,ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!,I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. ,3558

3560,lonely,Yeah  that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league  that's what I did.,Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.,3560

3573,disgusted,Oh gross  I would lose my appetite,Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.,3573
3574,disgusted,Yeah  I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether,It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.,3574
3575,terrified,Oh my goodness  that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?,I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.,3575
3576,terrified,They can still bite  so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.,When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones. ,3576
3577,angry,Do you have OCD?,I'm a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines. ,3577

3596,devastated,it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!,Sort of  the company was being run into the ground by poor management. It hurt at first but then I realized just how much I'd started to hate the work and the company.,3596

3638,terrified,That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though  it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!,This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.,3638

That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!,Yes  a lot of people don't have basements  and that would be really bad.

3640,embarrassed,Oh my goodness  are you alright? I bet you created a mess!,I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf. I climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!,3640

3644,sad,I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like  to me  that he lived a long life with you though  and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog,Last month  my dog Duke passed away. I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.,3644
3645,sad,That's crazy  and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point,Yeah  we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.,3645

3650,lonely,How long had you been married ?,Just over 2 years ago  my wife and I got divorced. It was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids.,3650
3651,lonely,Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.,Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.,3651
3652,surprised,I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.,Back when I was in college  I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.,3652
3653,surprised,Yeah  that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.,Exactly  especially when you get one for just walking.,3653
3654,excited,Cool  what are you getting?,My wife and I are going to buy are very first brand new car this week.,3654
3655,excited,That's a nice car  you are going to enjoy it.,A Chevy Cruze. We have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate.,3655

3657,prepared,That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain,Of course!  I have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring  and follow it.,3657
3658,proud,The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.,My daughter finally master the 1-6 times. We worked very hard on it this summer!,3658

3660,hopeful,What grade is she in?,My daughter starts public school for the first time in 3 years! I think she is going to do great but she's a little bit nervous.,3660
3661,hopeful,What kind of school was she at before?,She is in 5th grade.,3661
3662,joyful,Where did you go ?,Me and my family just came back from vacation we had a great time.,3662
3663,joyful,We went there a few years back. Had a great time.,We went to Disney world in Orlando Fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can't wait for our next vacation.,3663
3664,disappointed,Awesome news!  What was the response?,Well  I finally got a call back from that job I interviewed for the other day.,3664
3665,disappointed,Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!,Well  they decided not to hire me. This stinks.,3665
3666,surprised,That's awesome  I bet you were overjoyed with it!,My wife held a surprise birthday party for me. It was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I came home and so many people were there.,3666
3667,surprised,You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you  that's true!,I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.,3667
3668,angry,Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?,Last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower.,3668
3669,angry,Yeah  thieves are terrible.  I mean  who would steal a mower?,No  I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post  but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.,3669
3670,disgusted,what did you do?,My food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever.,3670
3671,disgusted,yea i can see that  it happens but it sucks,I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite. ,3671

3674,lonely,That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?,My wife is going away on a business trip soon.... she'll be gone for a couple of weeks.,3674
3675,lonely,I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.,Well  I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.,3675
3676,annoyed,spray water over there,Ugh  my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when I'm trying to sleep.,3676

3678,angry,Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?,Someone at work keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge! So infuriating!,3678
3679,angry,What would you do to them?,I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!,3679
3680,afraid,Yea  I used to hate it too.,I don't like the dark.,3680
3681,afraid,Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?,I get so worried about something happening to me.,3681

3684,impressed,That's pretty impressive  does he have any training or just all self taught?,So the fiance managed to rewire one of the wall outlets yesterday!,3684
3685,impressed,Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!,A little bit of both!  I didn't know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!,3685
3686,annoyed,That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!,Ugh  my neighbor's dog just keeps barking all day long. It's driving me insane.,3686
3687,annoyed,I am sure he thinks it's his world  the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude,It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it  but he doesn't seem to care at all.,3687
3688,afraid,Well you must be happy about it.,My brother is getting out of jail next week.,3688

3694,disgusted,Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.,I stepped out of my front door this morning... and right into an unpleasant surprise that my neighbor's dog left for me.,3694
3695,disgusted,Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.,Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.,3695
3696,joyful,That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.,I got a phone call from a friend that I haven't heard from in a really long time.,3696
3697,joyful,I bet you had tons of catching up to do!,I was! It was so great hearing from her again.,3697
3698,anxious,The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?,I have a meeting with my boss in a few hours...,3698
3699,anxious,Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be  then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you,See  that's the thing... I have no idea what to expect. That's why I'm so nervous about it.,3699
3700,sad,That is unfortunate  my own mother was ill for several years  she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?,My mother is getting very old. And she really isn't in great health these days...,3700

3707,anticipating,Thats hilarious  You finally got it though uhuh?,I was watching the front door like a hawk  and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.,3707
3708,disappointed,Im sure they had a good excuse.,A friend was supposed to meet me for lunch  but didn't show,3708

3831,caring,It's a tough choice to make  and not everyone has to raise a child.,I don't know if this is something I'll ever be ready for.,3831
3832,prepared,i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything,Have you ever mistaken a situation for something it is not and was ready for anything?,3832
3833,prepared,almost? so the situation resolved itself?,It's just that the other day I mistaken a guard for a tour guide and almost got in a fight.,3833
3834,hopeful,What kind of interview?,I have an interview with a local ad agency tomorrow. I hope I get it!,3834
3835,hopeful,Really? That is cool,An interview for a job.,3835
3836,surprised,How exactly?,yesterday my family surprised me on my birthday,3836
3837,surprised,I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.,well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday   not gonna lie i got really happy.,3837
3838,anxious,oh my god  how did you get out of there?,I got into a wrong part of town the other day  I was glad to get out from there.,3838
3839,anxious,that sounds great.,I realized I could walk very fast if I want to.,3839
3840,confident,That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.,In the past and even today I always felt strong in unfamiliar situations.,3840
3841,confident,Yeah it might just be something you're born with.,I agree  although I don't really know if you can train yourself to be like that.,3841
3842,nostalgic,I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.,I have old cassette player and music on it is much better than what I hear on a radio today. ,3842
3843,nostalgic,Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.,Yes  today it's just all about money and getting physical.,3843
3844,nostalgic,how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?,yesterday i went to the town where i grew up ,3844
3845,nostalgic,im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip,it did  so much nostalgia!,3845
3846,surprised,Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?,So it was supposed to rain  but when I got out it was beautifully sunny.,3846
3847,surprised,I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.,Sun is what makes me alive  so definitely yes.,3847
3848,grateful,i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though,When I walk past old people I feel fortunate that I'm still young.,3848
3849,grateful,def. make the best of them,Yes  but this part is inevitable  for now let us enjoy our young years.,3849
3850,lonely,It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.,When I feel an urge to get a girlfriend  I simply remember how nice it is to be independent.,3850
3851,lonely,Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.,Yes  I still think that there are good and bad sides in both of these cases.,3851
3852,furious,I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter,I get angry when people don't use trash cans.,3852
3853,furious,I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.,Good for you  instead of tickets this should be a punishment for everyone.,3853
3854,grateful,Are you in a dangerous place?,When I wake up  the first thing I do is thank life for having another day to enjoy.,3854
3855,grateful,I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!,No I'm not  but in away we all are in a very dangerous place  aren't we?,3855
3856,embarrassed,Oh no. Did it get ruined?,i was with my friend yesterday and by accident i spilled coffee on her laptop,3856
3857,embarrassed,Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while,i got so embarrassed but thankfully it didn't get ruined,3857
3858,sentimental,Really? So sorry for the lose,my grandmother passed away last week.,3858
3859,sentimental,Was she sick?,i'm really sad because she used to help me with everything ,3859
3860,disappointed,That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.,I entered a contest and I didn't win.,3860
3861,disappointed,Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!,No it isn't. I felt like I put a lot of effort into it too.,3861
3862,annoyed,That's not good  we ended up lucky with who we have ,we changed our internet provider last week and the connection is horrible.,3862
3863,annoyed,Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? ,i wish we did too.. but it's okay ,3863
3864,confident,that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?,I was one of three finalists for a job promotion where I work. I have more than double the other candidates experience  so I feel really good about my odds.,3864
3865,confident,Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate,I am a electrical engineer with more than 15 years experience. I have a really good feeling that I am going to get this job.,3865
3866,joyful,I agree  plus I love making snowmen! ,i can't wait for summer to finish   i love winter so much,3866
3867,joyful,I always get sad though when they melt ,snowmen are my favourite! ,3867
3868,embarrassed,Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?,Last week I was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and I stepped into a hole I did not see on the job site. I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.,3868
3869,embarrassed,Of course! Well  at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.,Yeah  my coworker did  but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.,3869
3870,afraid,That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?,We have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year. My son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside.,3870
3871,afraid,I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.,He is only three  so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.,3871
3872,apprehensive,That is a lot of extra money to spen  but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications  or meditation to help your nerves?,I had a client meeting in Dallas  and as I was driving to the airport I heard there was going to be a lot of storms we'd be flying through. I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.,3872
3873,apprehensive,I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying  but she did hypnosis and it really helped. ,I have  but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.,3873
3874,sad,Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?,Last month  this area got pounded with rainfall. My entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area.,3874
3875,sad,Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.,No  I move away from there some years ago  but I hate seeing the place I grew up basically destroyed now.,3875
3876,surprised,That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?,My birthday isn't for another two weeks  but my wife gave me my gift early yesterday. She bought me a brand new laptop because mine was getting old and slow.,3876
3877,surprised,Is that a gaming computer?,It's a Dell with a I7 and 8 gigs of ram  even has a Nvidia graphics card. She pretty much know what I wanted.,3877
3878,devastated,Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?,Last month our area received record amounts of rainfall. The river that is down from my house backed up so bad it flooded my entire house destroying practically everything.,3878
3879,devastated,I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.,Yes  we had insurance that is going to cover it  but it still sucks start from ground zero. Plus  insurance can't really replace some things.,3879
3880,apprehensive,Interesting....did you do it,My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.,3880
3881,apprehensive,lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end,Yeah  but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.,3881
3882,faithful,Why do you cheat on him?,My husband is so lucky I cheat on him like he did.,3882
3883,faithful,Oh I see  why are you still with him then?,I could have. But I didn't. He cheated on me actually.,3883
3884,hopeful,I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?,Damn  I really wanted my eBay package to arrive today  but it didn't.,3884
3885,hopeful,Haha  I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.,Indeed  I thought everything came this early.,3885
3886,hopeful,Yeah  the US is huge  landmass wise.,That sucks! I guess ground shipping takes ages in large countries. ,3886
3887,hopeful,You can always leave them an angry review online,I really really wished it would come today  I was even sat at the window looking for postal trucks and everything!,3887
3888,angry,What did your dog do?,I got so mad at my dog the other day.,3888
3889,angry,Oh no  well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.,He saw the rabbit that lives under my shed eating some grass in my yard  and decided to scare it and chase it away.,3889
3890,sad,What happened to you?,I am so upset about what happened yesterday. ,3890
3891,sad,That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?,I accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car.,3891
3892,impressed,Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time,I went to my first concert this weekend I seen Beyonce herself it was so awesome. ,3892
3893,impressed,I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!,Yes and I will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely. ,3893
3894,sad,that's terrible! how does that make you feel?,This past weekend I found out a friend of mine I went to school with passed away. He had a heart attack while he slept.,3894
3895,sad,That is the reality of life  unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.,It makes me feel old. I mean I am not that old  but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality. ,3895
3896,sad,That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?,I am upset I have to tell my daughter her pet died.,3896
3897,sad,Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.,She had it for 2 years. But I feel I must be honest with her.,3897
3898,surprised,Where are you going?,I can't believe my husband planned a trip all by him. ,3898
3899,surprised,That is going to be so fun!,I am still shocked he planned a cruise for 7 days.,3899
3900,prepared,I am never ready. which diet are you trying,I start my diet Monday and let's just say I am not ready to start lol.,3900
3901,prepared,I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started,The keto diet and I have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non I am so not arranged to start this up I need more time.,3901
3902,prepared,your welcome  and I will check out Keto.,I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.,3902
3903,caring,My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.,My dogs are my life more like my family I love them.,3903
3904,caring,Exactly! I am glad you have them,Yes they are you can't be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always. ,3904
3905,impressed,That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking  of course...,I can't believe my husband hid a talent her had from me for 15 years. ,3905
3906,impressed,Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then  huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.,I happen to come across all his drawings. He is as good as most professional artists! ,3906
3907,confident,how is that working out for you,I am starting back dancing ballet next month it's been a while since I last danced. ,3907
3908,confident,practice makes perfect,A little rusty but I know when I get in the class and hit the floor with my shoes I am more then positive it will be great.,3908
3909,annoyed,omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it? ,I hate I keep receiving double bills every month from Comcast.,3909
3910,annoyed,Sounds like a nightmare! total. ,Every month they shut off my service because I didn't pay the second bill. Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors.,3910
3911,sentimental,Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?,When I see my wedding picture around the house I always think back to that day.,3911
3912,sentimental,Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.,Yeah  just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now.,3912
3913,embarrassed,that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan,My favorite football team lost their preseason game and I talked so much smack to everyone saying they was going to win. ,3913
3914,embarrassed,lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other,I love the Jaguars I was ashamed I talk a lot of smack to everyone lol I guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol.,3914
3915,angry,Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around,I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school. ,3915
3916,angry,Thats awful! People should be arrested for that,I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.,3916
3917,sad,Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.,I lost some money yesterday in the parking lot I am still so unhappy about that.,3917
3918,sad,That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!,I know it is I lost $100 and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can't believe I was careless. ,3918
3919,annoyed,That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?,I decided to buy my son's supplies for kindergarten  they wanted very specific brands/counts.,3919
3920,annoyed,That's annoying  maybe they should provide links for you next time?,I'm not sure  it was just on the list.  I had a really hard time finding them.,3920
3921,anticipating,How did it go?,I just got out of a job interview for a customer assistant role.,3921
3922,anticipating,That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating. ,I think it went well  apart from a few mistakes  hopefully I got the job.,3922
3923,caring,Oh no  what happened?,I recently had to babysit my cousins  it was a disaster.,3923
3924,caring,There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.,They made a mess everywhere in the house. Really was not a good way to earn money.,3924
3925,excited,So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?,Yesterday was my birthday and I knew my girlfriend had a surprise planned for me  but no idea what it would be.,3925
3926,excited,She's must be a keeper then.,An awesome one! All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!,3926
3927,excited,That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?,Against all odds  I won two tickets to go to a music festival last summer.,3927
3928,excited,Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?,That's a shame! It was a festival called Pooza Fest. Many punk-rock and acoustic shows!,3928
3929,devastated,wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.,I won a pair of tickets to go to Rockfest this summer.,3929
3930,devastated,aww that stinks  i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money,I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately  none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.,3930
3931,surprised,That is crazy! How is he still employed?,My coworker constantly calls in.  The last couple weeks he had only come in on Fridays.  We made a friendly bet last night if he would come in today and I was pretty shocked when he actually was here on a Wednesday.,3931
3932,surprised,That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.,He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.,3932
3933,trusting,I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.,I told my best friends about an incident in where I self-harmed recently.,3933
3934,trusting,Thats what best friends are for  after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.,Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share  but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.,3934
3935,angry,Gesh  that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.,My dog keeps going into my garbage and throwing it all onto the floor!,3935
3936,angry,We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.,That's a good idea  I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.,3936
3937,surprised,That is awe inspiring  very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?,An eagle landed on my flag pole in my front yard last week!,3937
3938,surprised,I'm sure  that isn't something you see every day  or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.,I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still  it was really surprising.,3938
3939,disappointed,Well  that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.,I've been putting off my exam studying by being productive in other areas of my life.,3939
3940,disappointed,Yeah  that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.,Yeah... I'm pretty upset in myself for procrastinating  but also proud of what I've been accomplishing. I'm so conflicted in my emotions.,3940
3941,nostalgic,I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.,I was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite-brite.  I used to have a lite-brite and loved playing with it when I was younger.  It brought back some good memories.,3941
3942,nostalgic,Nope  they only know how to touch screens.,His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!,3942
3943,confident,That's great! How long have you two been together?,My girlfriend moved in last weekend.  I really feel like this is the right move for the next steps for us and our relationship.,3943
3944,confident,You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them  so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.,Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.,3944
3945,disgusted,Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.,A friend of mine hadn't taken out her garbage in weeks.,3945
3946,disgusted,Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.,You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it  I felt sick to my stomach.,3946
3947,joyful,Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile,I really hate moving. My girlfriend just moved in last weekend. Im really happy she moved in but Im also SUPER happy that the move is finally over.,3947
3948,joyful,I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious,Haha  the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks.  I'm hoping we dont have to again for a while!,3948
3949,afraid,That sounds pretty amazing  what convention was it?,I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to volunteer for one of my favorite companies at a convention.,3949
3950,afraid,I'm so happy for you  it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!,Otakuthon 2018. It was so amazing  I ended up doing really great!,3950
3951,nostalgic,That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?,i was looking at my old photo album today  it brought back a lot of memories,3951
3952,nostalgic,I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.,the one where i was eating ice cream  oh god i miss eating ice cream,3952
3953,surprised,oh yea? and what did they get you?,"""I told my family I wanted nothing a few Christmas' ago  even if I knew they'd get me something anyways.",3953
3954,surprised,Oh nice.  Those are fun.  I love playing video games,I got an Xbox One  and I had no idea how much fun I'd have until I received it.,3954
3955,surprised,Oh yes? What happened?,I went for a run last month and the most unexpected thing happened to me.,3955
3956,surprised,Oh  that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.,I was running on a road with a sidewalk  I turned the corner and saw a deer staring at me. Can't believe I found one in my small suburban neighborhood.,3956
3957,content,That's not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?,My little brother was stuck gaming on a horrendously slow computer for years.,3957
3958,content,Wow  you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!,Kind of. I built myself a new PC  and gave him my previous one. I re-built it for him and made sure everything would work perfectly!,3958
3959,content,What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.,Thanks! Seeing him smile as he played with high frame rates and nice graphics brought me such joy. ,3959
3960,content,I love my brother  too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!,I love my siblings so much  they're the best.,3960
3961,furious,Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.,My older sister stole money from me.,3961
3962,furious,That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.,Yeah  no one else in the household would ever do something like that. The worst thing is  my parents did nothing about it.,3962
3963,nostalgic,I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!,Today I woke from an amazing dream which i had  it brought back a lot of amazing memories  memories which i wish i could go back to...,3963
3964,nostalgic,Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?,Yeah  but at the same time  it motivated me for the day which was nice,3964
3965,proud,That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.,Last week as we were finishing up on a job site  the client was over joyed at the way we had done the installation. I couldn't help but keep smiling since it was my design.,3965
3966,proud,You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.,Yes  it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model. ,3966
3967,disgusted,Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.,i was just like the usual  working on my website  and then i saw a disgusting advert which was about society,3967
3968,disgusted,I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.,yeah  but i wish it wasn't like this,3968
3969,hopeful,Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.,My girlfriend moved in over the weekend.  We have a ton of boxes to unpack but I am thinking it should be something that can be done in the next couple weeks.,3969
3970,hopeful,Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!,I think thats the plan.  After those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done.  Not a huge rush and were both super happy...well I am.  I'm assuming she is too!,3970
3971,content,That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?,today i woke up  and i realised that i am more than content with my life  it made me happy and peaceful ,3971
3972,content,Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.,yes  i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life,3972
3973,excited,oh nice! i know that feeling  is it home? what made you think about going there?,Im going to Chicago in a couple weeks.  I havent been there for about 15 years so I'm really looking forward to it.,3973
3974,excited,nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!,It isnt home but I went there for family trips when I was younger. My girlfriends friend is having a baby shower and lives there so I'm tagging along and were going to make a long weekend out of it!,3974
3975,surprised,yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about,I really don't like randomly pumping into old friends  it get's me nervous  and i saw one of my old friend's today and  i was surprised  to say the least,3975
3976,surprised,yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?,yeah  so i tried to look for a way out before i admit defeat  but then i realised there was no way out and so i talked to them in the end,3976
3977,surprised,well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction,yeah it wasn't bad in the end  just awkward ,3977
3978,surprised,Do you think they deserved it?,A co-worker of mine was fired at work,3978
3979,surprised,"Well as they say  ""Better them than you""",No  their performance seemed to be good,3979
3980,impressed,that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress,Today my wife worked super hard for our future and made an amazing progress ,3980

4152,sad,I would feel terrible too. Where did you move to?,I remember when my friends were helping me move out of our hometown.  We were riding in the moving truck and it came time to drop them off and say goodbye.  We all felt terrible.,4152
4153,sad,I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before  so I completely understand. Those were rough times.,I moved to a town about 30-45 minutes away  but at that point we were so used to seeing each other every day of our lives.  It was hard to get used to.,4153
4154,disgusted,That sucks  imagine being in an environment like that all day  I would go crazy,The manager the store was very mean and rude to the employees. I could not beleive it. ,4154
4155,disgusted,I guess some people are just really rude  no matter what position you put them in,I agree. It made me sick to my stomach seeing it. I feel bad for them!,4155
4156,apprehensive,It's hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didn't do it.,Last night my GPS asked me to make a right down a dark and scary road. ,4156
4157,apprehensive,I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you. ,I was very nervous and doubting to do it. I actually did and it wasnt that bad,4157

4160,disappointed,Why was she upset? Depending on how many people entered  fifth could be really good.,Last night my neice placed 5th at her dance performance. She was so upset and so was I,4160
4161,disappointed,That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people. ,There were 30 girls. We worked very hard and felt she would place top 3 but what an outcome it was to be 5th. ,4161
4162,content,NIce! I bet you cant wait! Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?,I am very excited to not have any plans this weekend. It's going to be so nice to relax for two whole days.,4162

4169,afraid,Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..,I dont know. I hate heights  so im very nervous about it,4169
4170,disgusted,That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?,My roommate leaves leftovers in the fridge and they get moldy.,4170
4171,disgusted,That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.,No. I'm not very confrontational. And our lease is up in two months anyway so I'm just going to wait it out.,4171
4172,annoyed,Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?,I was at the library today and was trying to study  but this lady across the table was smacking her gum very loud. ,4172
4173,annoyed,That was very rude of her to do that  some people just have no manners.,well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated,4173

4190,annoyed,That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.,My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep. ,4190
4191,annoyed,I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!,I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months.,4191

4198,annoyed,Why not block the calls?,My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down. ,4198

4208,faithful,You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people. ,I met my wife online 7 years ago and can't see myself with anyone else  ever.,4208
4209,faithful,That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.,Oh I know. I got lucky  we found out we lived really close to each other so we met up and it has been great ever since.,4209
4210,trusting,Wow  watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?,My daughter has worked very hard to keep her school work finished  her room clean  and the dishes washed. I bought her a cell phone for her birthday this year. She is becoming a responsible young preteen,4210
4211,trusting,That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.,"She has been good so far. We are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day. She also had to ""turn it in"" at night before she goes to bed.",4211

4215,apprehensive,Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?,I had a septic tank issue and called a guy that I found a business card from and had him come out. He didn't have hardly any equipment with him and sounded like he didn't know what to do.,4215
4216,apprehensive,You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.,No. I just asked what it would cost to fix then told him I couldn't afford it to get him to leave. ,4216
4217,ashamed,If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!,I bought a big bag of M&Ms and I could not resist it,4217
4218,ashamed,maybe save the other half for later. lol.,well that is what I just did  so far I have eaten half of it,4218
4219,ashamed,That's ok  it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.,I do not think I can and feel ashamed that I cannot resist it,4219
4220,trusting,How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? ,I told my girlfriend about my self harm habits a little while ago.,4220
4221,trusting,Now that your girlfriend knows the problem   the both of you can work on solutions and support together.,She was really sad  but she appreciated the fact that I told her. ,4221
4222,apprehensive,Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?,My friends wanted to bring me to laser quest for my birthday.,4222
4223,apprehensive,I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.,Yeah exactly. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not and I was a little unwilling to try it out. ,4223
4224,ashamed,Oh that sounds worrisome  do you think you will pass?,I spent all of summer doing everything but studying for my final exam,4224
4225,ashamed,I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly  if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.,I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail and I feel awful about myself  but I just can't get myself to do it.,4225
4226,devastated,That sounds intensive! How did it go?,My friends and I had spent all day troubleshooting a new PC build that we had just completed.,4226
4227,devastated,I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.,It went awful. It turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces. So much wasted time!,4227
4228,devastated,That's a good bright side to look at.,It really was. At least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!,4228
4229,caring,Did you save it or kill it?,I found an injured spider with a leg missing in my bathroom a few days ago.,4229

4238,faithful,Good man  I have a lot of respect for that.,Nah. I have a loving girlfriend and I would never cheat on her.,4238

4240,prepared,Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!,Oh yeah definitely. Never have I ever felt so ready for anything in my life.,4240

4245,trusting,Awesome  I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.,My said he did!  I had quite a bit of confidence in him  based on others' feedback.,4245
4246,jealous,How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.,When I was a kid  all my friends had Yu-Gi-Oh cards but me.,4246
4247,jealous,Well  they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.,I think my parents found them expensive  otherwise I can't think of any other good reason. To be honest  I kind of envied my friends.,4247
4248,confident,Nice  Was it hard to start?,I took up running and I started seeing a huge improvement in my cardiovascular endurance.,4248
4249,confident,Wish i could run close to 5km  i'd struggle with 100 meters.,Unimaginably hard. But once I got into it I couldn't stop. I'm feeling pretty certain that I'll hit my 5km goal in no time.,4249

4254,anxious,damn  is he ok now?,A few months ago  a good friend of mine that I look up to attempted suicide.,4254

4256,terrified,Oh no! Was it a fun night? ,I drank too much and passed out a few months ago. ,4256
4257,terrified,Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though! ,It was  but it got scary at some point. Apparently people were trying to wake me up by shaking me and I would not get up.,4257
4258,sentimental,Aww  that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?,I was packing up my house to move  and found my old yearbooks! It's so weird to look back and see how far everyone I knew in high school has come.,4258

4306,ashamed,Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.,I was very late to work today and they were so busy with patients.,4306
4307,ashamed,Its always best to be on time   I hope they understand no one is perfect.,Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me  especially on Fridays  when we are the busiest. ,4307
4308,apprehensive,The journey there is always the toughest  its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it,My boss told me to go to school to become a doctor instead of a nurse. I felt like it was a compliment. Im worried about how much and how long medical school will take.,4308
4309,apprehensive,With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time,I agree. I guess I will weigh my options  its just im getting old and watn to start a family too  so I dont know.,4309
4310,faithful,Wow   that was serious then,My friend and I got in an argument about religion today. It made me question my faith. ,4310
4311,faithful,OK   so what is your plan now? ,Yeah. I want to stay true to my beliefs  but she made some very valid points. ,4311
4312,apprehensive,Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?,I remember back when I started college. I moved to a new state where I didn't know anyone and I had no idea what to expect.,4312
4313,apprehensive,Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people,Yes  I did eventually. There's something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in.,4313
4314,devastated,Oh  that must have been a hard thing to do. I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...,Today I had to tell a patient about her lab results. Come to find out she could not have babies. She was very upset.,4314
4315,devastated,So sad...that makes me want to cry  too  just hearing about her reaction.,Yeah I felt bad. She started crying so much. Its like her world ended there.,4315
4316,sentimental,I bet it does! Do you go by there often?,Whenever I go back to my hometown I love driving by the house I grew up in. I have such great memories.,4316
4317,sentimental,I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.,I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.,4317
4318,ashamed,Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.,I found out some bad news the other day.,4318
4319,ashamed,Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?,I just got back my grade for my final for my class and I failed it. I studied real hard  but unfortunately it didn't seem to matter.,4319
4320,ashamed,Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3,I'm going to have to at least try. Maybe they'll be understanding and let me attempt again.,4320
4321,ashamed,Oh no why would they do such a thing,Someone twisted what I Said earlier today to make it seem like i was saying something else. I felt reall ybad.,4321
4322,ashamed,Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.,They were angry and wanted to be aggressive. ,4322
4323,faithful,That's not cool. I bet it felt awkward.,Some lady I know tried to hit on me even though she very well knew I am in a relationship!,4323
4324,faithful,You are a stand up person!,It really did but I would never do something to jeopardize my relationship.,4324
4325,content,Nice  silence is golden,I had a nice quiet evening at home tonight.,4325
4326,content,Full of what?,Well  my family was here  too.  Toddlers don't make life quiet  but they make me feel fulfilled.,4326
4327,ashamed,Oh no  was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?,There was a meeting scheduled today that I thought was utterly pointless.,4327
4328,ashamed,Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling. ,It definitely was  so I ended up skipping it.,4328
4329,trusting,Oh really  were you supposed to tell them?,I told my close friend a very big secret yesterday.,4329
4330,trusting,You can never be to sure now a days  they might post your secret to social media.,It was my choice. I really don't think they'll tell anyone! They're good people.,4330
4331,confident,Did you ace your test?,One time I was really sure that I was going to ace a test because I studied all night,4331
4332,confident,I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately  I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!,Yup  I was worried during the test too  but I am glad everything turned out okay,4332
4333,jealous,Nice  what a legend and a gentleman,A friend at work recently got a raise.  That's the 2nd one in the last year for him!,4333
4334,jealous,Word  you should ask him what the secret is,Yeah  but I haven't had one in 3 years.,4334
4335,faithful,That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me  the guilt would destroy me.,I was totally committed to him in every way I could be.   HOwever he ended up cheating on me,4335
4336,faithful,Yeah Freud called it Projection  it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.,It would me too  not only that but he just up and got with her like I never existed to him.   Its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and I had no clue why.  It was him the whole time!,4336
4337,trusting,It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...,He kept doing drugs  and taking things that didnt belong to him.  It broke my heart but I didnt know what else to do.,4337
4338,trusting,You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.,Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.,4338
4339,faithful,Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?,today after coming back from work i saw my wife and she was asking me why are you late with questioning eyes  i told her that i wen't to go and get her favourite meal  i felt so faithful ,4339
4340,faithful,It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.,she was joking about it  but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together  it was such a nice day,4340
4341,trusting,That's inspiring  has that worked for you in the past in the same way?,after a long day from work  i was stuck at this math problem  but then i decided to go for a walk instead of working on the problem  i trust my guts  after i had come back from the walk  the solution kicked in and i was able to do the problem,4341
4342,trusting,That's so cool  you seem very intuitive,yes always  it is something that works for me,4342
4343,apprehensive,That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?,it was 3am  i was walking at the utter night... i was scared out of my mind... anything could happen  my walking speed increased... and everything i was seeing suddenly became more and more scary,4343
4344,apprehensive,Why were you walking so late at night?,in the end yes.. but the journey was sure hell,4344
4345,content,Nice  what are some things you realized?,today i realised the small details of my life and i feel more satisfied,4345
4346,content,You don't have me yet <3,that i have everything i wished for.,4346
4347,prepared,oh god  how did you . have the courage to even go outside?,One time I bought water and snacks before a hurricane came to wreck my city,4347
4348,prepared,that sounds like an adventurous day ,My house flooded so I had to get on my roof !,4348
4349,furious,Wow  how could they do that?,One time they put cheese in my hamburger when I told them not to!,4349
4350,furious,Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!,They are complete monsters I tell ya!,4350
4351,embarrassed,You should. No matter what you can't lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.,i lied to my mother and i feel very uneasy,4351
4352,embarrassed,Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.,i just realised this now,4352
4353,confident,Nice! Do you have any superpowers?,i am beginning to realise in my abilities and i feel so confident in them  i am able to anything,4353

4358,hopeful,That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?,Hell yeah  no more living in mom's basement!,4358

4360,caring,oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?,Well at first I thought it was cute until I saw him at the gas station the other day.  I overheard him asking someone that was getting gas if he happened to have a little change he could have.  He needed to get home in his lawnmower but didn't have the money to do so.   I ended up giving him 3 bucks.,4360
4361,caring,That is so kind of you  I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person  but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.  ,i believe i am a really caring person  because i always take care of cats and feed them and lately they are more and more close to me,4361
4362,caring,I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .,i am a both person ahaha i also have a dog  but he is always so mean ,4362

4366,disappointed,Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.,Yes  I was off by one number. I was going to be a millionaire!,4366
4367,nostalgic,Yeah  it's like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same,every day the weather makes me feel so nostalgic  the colors  the wind all bring back a certain memory from my past,4367
4368,nostalgic,Yup  and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well,yes! i am so glad you get it  it's beautiful but also sad at the same time,4368
4369,disgusted,I think I would leave if I saw something like that.,One time I went into the public restroom and saw poop smeared everywhere! Ew!,4369
4370,disgusted,Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?,I left as fast as possible!,4370
4371,disgusted,It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.,Nope  just you!,4371
4372,anxious,I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account  how's school going?,One time I was so nervous to look at my grade for my final exam,4372
4373,anxious,Word  college is tough  wishing you the best,I failed and dropped out! Now I live in my parents house doing nothing all day,4373
4374,furious, and got upset with you?,like who on earth writes var int value = 1  this is so ridiculous i am so annoyed at my brother  after everything i tought him  he doesn't even know the basics ,4374
4375,furious, And why do not you try to teach your brother?,no i was the one who was upset with him,4375
4376,anticipating,Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out  though.,i am working so hard  that i can see a pile of money building up for my future ,4376
4377,anticipating,That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.,it doesn't i am taking regular breaks,4377
4378,terrified,Dang  how fast did you run away?,One time I saw a creepy person run towards me in the night out in the streets,4378
4379,terrified,Did you tell him how creepy he is lol,I froze up because I was terrified. It was just my brother though,4379
4380,sentimental,That is awesome  what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly? ,While I was packing my stuff to move  I found Old high school pictures. It made me think of all the good times  I had.,4380
4381,sentimental,Aww yeah  those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! ,Well more of my old best friend. I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me. ,4381
4382,anxious,It's not fair  eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? ,being alive is so much stress and anxiety  why does it have to be like this? why can't we just all express our individual selves  instead we are forced to work so that we can eat ,4382
4383,anxious,Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of  wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone  someway or another.,Yes  it's true we all know this inside out  but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives  the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting  if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life  not one which just gives the impression of freedom  that's all there is now  faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings,4383
4384,sentimental,Oh wow  what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? ,I watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings.,4384
4385,sentimental,oh wow that sounds very emotional  I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. ,I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.,4385
4386,disappointed,I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me,i am so disappointed in myself  i could have do so much better at work but i guess it wasn't my day  i was not able to focus,4386
4387,disappointed,May be you are right. But sometimes  you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.,what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy's law ,4387
4388,caring,Oh no  I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? ,My grandma ended up getting really sick this last week.,4388
4389,caring,That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :),She is getting much better. My family and I did everything we could to take care of her.,4389
4390,guilty,Oh no  maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!,i feel so guilty  my sister crying because 'someone eat her cake' that she had been saving for 2 days now  and that someone was non other than me...,4390
4391,guilty,Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too  I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :) ,oh wow you are such a genius! why didn't i think of that before... there is always a bright side to everything,4391
4392,joyful,I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?,words cannot describe how happy i am  in 2 weeks time i will go and see my wife i am so joyful and exciting ,4392
4393,joyful,Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon,no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her  but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart  ,4393
4394,embarrassed,Oh no what happened  are you alright? ,I had a terrible experience at the grocery store today.,4394
4395,embarrassed,Oh no that must have been a terrible experience  I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.,Yeah  I'm alright. But I dropped a jar of pasta sauce and it ended up shattering. Sauce got all over the floor.,4395
4396,anticipating,That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?,I aced all my classes this semester  so Im hoping and thinking my GPA will be a 4.0,4396
4397,anticipating,wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.,I actually gave more effort this semester  so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.,4397
4398,prepared,It sounds like you're quite the organized person!,So everything for a party im throwing this weekend is ready and everything is paid for. I have it ready last week so I wouldnt stress.,4398
4399,prepared,I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.,Yea. I like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well.,4399
4400,confident,That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :) ,Im going to ask my girlfriend to marry me this weekend! I have no doubt in my mind she will say no,4400
4401,confident,That is great  I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! ,Thanks! I think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her.,4401
4402,afraid,I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters  if we make a difference or not  we all end up dust in the end.,i am so afraid... afraid that i am not giving too much to the world  what if i parish not having done anything?,4402
4403,afraid,If telling yourself that makes you feel better  I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.,no  i don't believe that  whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage  just like birth death is a process,4403
4404,disgusted,Yeah  70s were incredible  the dancing the cars  the women had style and the music was incredible.,the world is such a disgusting place now  i wish i was born back in the 70s ,4404
4405,disgusted,But we got to make the best of it  pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.,RIGHT?! but now is just so bad  i wish i could go back,4405
4406,grateful,Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.,today everyone said congratulations to me  as i succeed in making an amazing app  and now i am so greatful to be alive! ,4406
4407,grateful,There will always be people that are jealous of your success  but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.,thank you! it's always nice to tell you these things  you don't get jealous and you are just happy for me  thank you,4407
4408,furious,Oh no  can you return it or get a refund?,I came home from work today to a disaster. My dog chewed up the new couch i just purchased.,4408
4409,furious,I am sorry to hear that  I would have felt the same way. ,No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!,4409
4410,hopeful,That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.,I gave my dog away to a family today. I did not have time for him since work and school take alot of it up.,4410
4411,hopeful,I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!,I agree  but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.,4411
4412,jealous,OH no! Are you the jealous type?,I saw my girlfriend getting real friendly with another guy at the bar last night,4412
4413,jealous,OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!,It definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation.,4413
4414,confident,oh no do you feel ready for it? ,I have a test coming up next week.,4414
4415,confident,That is great  I believe that you will do amazing! ,I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.,4415
4416,annoyed,Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?,I AM SO ANNOYED! i have been trying to solve this math problem for 2 hours now,4416
4417,annoyed,Oh I see  well good luck to you  I hope you'll solve it soon.,there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on  it's the problem of non-polynomial descent ,4417
4418,content,That is great  what has been going on in your life recently?,I'm really feeling alright about how my life is going right now.,4418
4419,content,That is good  sometimes that is all you really need to do  get things done  one step at a time :) ,I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.,4419
4420,nostalgic,They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?,The ads for the new World Of Warcraft expansion really makes me think about when I played it many years ago.,4420
4421,nostalgic,If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.,It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.,4421
4422,furious,That is always frustrating. What happened?,I woke up to something super annoying this morning.,4422
4423,furious,Wow  some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.,I woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night. No note or anything.,4423
4424,disappointed,What did he do?,I'm really disappointed in my son's actions that I was told about.,4424
4425,disappointed,Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?,He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.,4425
4426,disgusted,What was it that you accidentally ate?,I ate such a disgusting thing the other day by accident.,4426
4427,disgusted,Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?,I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.,4427
4428,trusting,I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.,I recently had my first child.  I was absolutely terrified when I went into labour but I put all my faith in the wonderful midwives and everything worked out perfectly!,4428
4429,trusting,You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody  I agree.,it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career  its not just a job but a vocation.,4429
4430,guilty,I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?,I started a diet today and just as soon as I get home I eat a burger!,4430
4431,guilty,Don't be too hard on yourself  it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying  I believe in you!,Fried foods. I feel bad I didn't commit to it the first day. ,4431
4432,guilty,I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!,Thank you! I need that motivation so I can get over this shame im feeling. ,4432
4433,anxious,Why not? What happens tomorrow?,I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow.,4433
4434,anxious,Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!,I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow. ,4434
4435,afraid,That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!,I changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight. There was a man standing in the dark.,4435
4436,afraid,I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!,I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine. ,4436
4437,hopeful,I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!,My brother is going into surgery tomorrow.,4437
4438,hopeful,I am sure the procedure will go excellently.,I'm really hoping so! I've been really worried.,4438
4439,impressed,That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!,Today my friend had all of is awe  becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing. ,4439
4440,impressed,That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.,I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.,4440
4441,apprehensive,He's a brave man. How was the experience?,I have such a fear of flying  so you can just imagine how I felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my 30th birthday! He was so excited and I was so nervous and uneasy.,4441
4442,apprehensive,It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!,Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.

4445,sentimental,Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?,I was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book.  It is a long time since I left school and couldnt believe I even still had it.  Such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories.,4445
4446,sentimental,It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.,Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those  especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.,4446
4447,trusting,That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.,So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town. ,4447

4451,lonely,Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.,Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either. ,4451
4452,lonely,Im sure your not though! ,Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself. ,4452
4453,devastated,Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?,I had the worst experience last weekend.  I woke up to find someone had stolen my car! I was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it.,4453
4454,devastated,Yeah i would have felt the same way. ,Well yes.  While i was in my daze  absolutely horrified  my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.,4454
4455,devastated,yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.,Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!,4455
4456,annoyed,That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon,Today after a long day at work I sat in traffic for 2 hours due to construction on the freeway!,4456
4457,annoyed,That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.,Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks. ,4457
4458,nostalgic,How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.,My old friend suprised me with a phone call today. I have not heard from her since high school. ,4458
4459,nostalgic,That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.,Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!,4459
4460,caring,Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?,A little stray pup appeared on my driveway yesterday.  My initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter.  However no one had reported him.  I decided to take him in  wash him and feed him.  I have never been much of an animal person but I couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy.,4460
4461,caring,The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! ,I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him  even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward  I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!,4461
4462,ashamed,Oh wow  that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.,I got super wasted. I accidentally messed myself in front of people,4462
4463,ashamed,That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!,Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink,4463
4464,joyful,What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.,I'm really excited for this next weekend!,4464
4465,joyful,That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!,A friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!,4465
4466,terrified,That's interesting. Are you okay?,I had a really scary experience the other day.,4466
4467,terrified,That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.,Yeah  I'm fine. My friend got into a car crash while I was in the car though.,4467
4468,afraid,Why what happened?,I went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it.,4468
4469,afraid,Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.,I ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun. Luckily  I made it back to my group at some point.,4469
4470,ashamed,Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.,When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible.,4470
4471,ashamed,That's probably a good idea.,oh yes she has  it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!,4471
4472,sad,I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?,My last day of work was yesterday. I got so emotional driving home and I cried.,4472
4473,sad,Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.,Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. ,4473
4474,angry,hmmn  really?..i guess you must have felt very bad,Yesterday I found my boyfriend with someone else!,4474
4475,angry,am so sorry about that  did he apologize?,I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.,4475
4476,ashamed,Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?,One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape  because I was self conscious of how I looked.,4476
4477,ashamed,It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. ,Well the costume itself ended up looking great  since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it  so I felt bad.,4477
4478,ashamed,Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.,That's true  but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.,4478
4479,faithful,In reference to what?,Whom do you belive the most,4479
4480,faithful,My husband is my most trusted companion.,Your trustful person?,4480
4481,ashamed,That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?,my father couldn't stope any lower  how can someone take money from their own child,4481
4482,ashamed,How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.,i did many times  but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything,4482
4483,trusting,That's really nice  however  to keep the marriage fresh and strong  I think it's important for you to have outside friends.,my wife is always there for me  so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her  she is my faith,4483
4484,trusting,Haha  well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you  then don't change anything.,that's only normie talk  we are both introverted and we hate people,4484
4485,ashamed,what did you do???,i am a joke  i am ashemed of what i did,4485
4486,ashamed,well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers,i builied someone because they made fun of my mother  but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that,4486
4487,devastated,stay hopeful!   they'll release it sooner or later,I  waited 3 years for them to realise season 3 and they promised it was to be released today  i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :/ it's just so annoying,4487
4488,devastated,it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.,i hope so :<,4488
4489,sentimental,That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. ,I still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that I've had since I was young.  It's still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood.,4489
4490,sentimental,That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. ,Yeah  it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.,4490
4491,sentimental,....what feelings? what are you talking about,a young girl  crying  sadden by the cruelity of our elders  told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental,4491
4492,sentimental,oh man  that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?,she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset,4492
4493,jealous,That doesn't sound very good  but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with,i am so envious of my sister  she has everything i just want to make her life hell,4493
4494,jealous,Other people deserve to have things  too.,yeah but only i should get everything! no one else,4494
4495,embarrassed,"Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell  ""Safe!""",i am so embaressed at myself... i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd ,4495
4496,embarrassed,Awww  well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. ,indeed  but this time i was red and yelling in my head,4496
4497,content,eh not really. what about you,don't you think life is peaceful? are you content?,4497
4498,content,and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?,i did  espcially today when i woke up  i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that  so i decided to work hard on becoming free,4498
4499,content,i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors,i will work on the things i enjoy  which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often,4499
4500,devastated,Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?,I've known my best friend since I was 4 years old.  He joined the Air Force after high school and moved out of state and I was really upset when he left.,4500
4501,devastated,I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. ,Oh yeah  we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.,4501
4502,apprehensive,Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. ,the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what's about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it,4502
4503,apprehensive,If there is something in particular  try to deal with it head on. ,i hope so,4503
4504,faithful,that is great.. may i know what you have learnt,I have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off. I am feeling faithful again. ,4504
4505,faithful,it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it,I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.,4505
4506,faithful,great day to you too,Thank you sir  have a great day!,4506
4507,prepared,How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!,i am so prepared the exam tomorrow!,4507

4509,confident,I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?,tomorrow i have interview and i have done my study so i am feeling confident,4509

4511,anticipating,Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.,I did so well in that biology exam haha  i anticipated those questions to come up i was so ready,4511

4513,furious,Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?,i am so mad at myself  i woke up late again today and missed a very important deadline  even though i set 4 alarms,4513
4514,furious,Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.,no  i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem,4514
4515,apprehensive,Why do you need to go to the doctor?,I really hate going to the doctor. I was hesitant about going this time.,4515
4516,apprehensive,Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?,I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.,4516
4517,ashamed,That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?,I was planning on going to grad school and I told a lot of people. I ended up not going  and I felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going.,4517
4518,ashamed,Right. ,Yes. Without really giving details  I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.,4518
4519,sentimental,Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?,I found a picture of my daughter and me from when I took her to a waterfall a long time ago. It brought tears to my eyes.,4519
4520,sentimental,One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.,Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23. ,4520
4521,trusting,I totally understand  I hate carnival rides too  they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?,I have the worst fear of carnival rides  i always think they,4521
4522,trusting,Agreed  a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards  but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.,(pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides  but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up  too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.,4522
4523,devastated,Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?,My wife's cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs,4523
4524,devastated,I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?,Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%,4524
4525,apprehensive,That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition,I was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm  no visibility. I had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than 10 minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over.,4525
4526,apprehensive,I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.,Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.,4526
4527,ashamed,It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.,Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady  felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too.,4527
4528,ashamed,It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!,I hope so  i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.,4528
4529,devastated,Oh  that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?,I bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen  first time this happens and it was just terrible.,4529
4530,devastated,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.,No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.,4530
4531,ashamed,Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much  its just natural behavior for them  take him to training school.,I was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog,4531
4532,ashamed,Oh then yeah  invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.,Not really  but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.,4532
4533,sentimental,Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.,Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away  felt nice seeing her on video again.,4533
4534,sentimental,I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.,Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.,4534
4535,content,That's awesome!  Congratulations!,I got the scores for my final exam. got a B and passed the class  it was a good day to celebrate.,4535
4536,content,Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate,Yeah  i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.,4536
4537,anticipating,That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones,Ordered a new pair of headphones online. They are a really high end pair so I'm very excited to finally get them.,4537
4538,anticipating,I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!,Yeah  it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.,4538
4539,caring,Oh thats heartbreaking  do you guys already have children?,My wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children. I am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work.,4539
4540,caring,I really hope she gets better too  it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.,I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.,4540
4541,jealous,Young love  it's such a bittersweet quest.,Back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy. I was jealous for a while but it didn't matter anyways. I ended up getting her.,4541
4542,jealous,I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.,It is  those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.,4542
4543,sentimental,It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone,I had a lot of feelings when I found pictures of my dog who has passed.,4543
4544,sentimental,You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!,It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.,4544
4545,content,Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?,I moved to my current town one year ago and I really like it here. I'm happy and couldn't think of a better place to live.,4545
4546,content,That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.,It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.,4546
4547,trusting,That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.,I very much could count on my mom to always be there for me.,4547
4548,trusting,Is there anything she does specifically for her?,Me too. I am so thankful for her.,4548
4549,devastated,I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?,I was upset when I failed my math test,4549
4550,devastated,Oh  okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.,I did  but the material was a hard subject.,4550
4551,faithful,That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?,I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me.,4551
4552,faithful,That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.,Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@,4552
4553,trusting,Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?,Hi friend! Wow  I was so scared of this taxi driver when I was vacationing in Mexico. He looked rather suspicious.,4553
4554,trusting,Oh  well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol,No  I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. ,4554
4555,sentimental,I usually love the trips down memory lane  but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.,I was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday. It made me wish I could go back and time and see some relatives again.,4555
4556,sentimental,I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.,It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again  but sad to miss them.,4556
4557,ashamed,Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings,I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't,4557
4558,ashamed,Yeah  I think that means you have a conscience  which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad  I'd worry about you!,I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.,4558
4559,trusting,That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly  playful cat too.,Sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and I hold my cat over my head and we chase it. She hasn't scratched or bitten me once while we do this!,4559
4560,trusting,Yes  they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.,I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!,4560
4561,caring,That was thoughtful  sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!,I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me  even though he kicks a lot.,4561
4562,caring,Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.,Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool  but he's still very much a little kid.,4562
4563,caring,My mistake :),I'm an auntie :p,4563
4564,faithful,I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!,my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what  I can count on her.,4564
4565,faithful,I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!,yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you,4565
4566,content,Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.,I had a great breakfast this morning. It was delicious and I felt very happy and relaxed.,4566
4567,content,Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy  hash brown and eggs...,Eggs  bacon  strawberries  tomatoes  and coffee. So yummy!,4567
4568,embarrassed,I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.,I called someone by the wrong name earlier today. I didn't really know them and hadn't seen them in ages.,4568
4569,embarrassed,I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.,They were ok with it  but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.,4569
4570,embarrassed,What happened? The yard always has mysteries!,The other day we were in the front yard  and you won't believe what happened!,4570
4571,embarrassed,Shocking! Has your kid done that before?,My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!,4571
4572,ashamed,Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.,I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :(,4572
4573,ashamed,You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. ,Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.,4573
4574,ashamed,Your welcome! Glad I could help!,That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :),4574
4575,jealous,I can understand the feeling  I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.,I'm unemployed and struggling right now. I feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff  even though they're not trying to be mean,4575
4576,jealous,You'll return to self-sufficiency soon  you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.,yeah! I just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family,4576
4577,devastated,Aww  that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.,I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying....,4577
4578,devastated,That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves,It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.,4578
4579,caring,Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example  is it quite tough?,One of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother. So I am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday. She is so cute!,4579
4580,caring,Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?,No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy. ,4580
4581,caring,Keep up the good work!,Yes! I think so  haha!,4581
4582,content,I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.,I feel very happy that I moved out in the country. I thought I was a city person but I guess not.,4582
4583,content,All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.,Oh yes. It was hard to get used to at first but now I barely notice it.,4583

4586,jealous,Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?,I really wanted to go on this fruitarian trip to Bali butI could not get off work. My friends went without me,4586
4587,jealous,Yeah you might want to look into it then,No. My boss is not a very nice person. I think I should find a new job.,4587
4588,sentimental,Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?,My dog is feeling sick and I don't know what is wrong.,4588
4589,sentimental,Yes  google has a lot of great information for pet care.,I hate the vets. They charge so much money. Maybe I can google seomthing.,4589
4590,confident,Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!,I am learning how to do day trading and did my first trade and I won,4590
4591,confident,I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.,You think? It sure is exciting  at least when I win.,4591
4592,confident,I wish you the very best with it all!,Your right. Let's see how I do next week.,4592
4593,confident,You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard  they don't always turn the way you might hope!,Thanks my friend!,4593
4594,furious,I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.,My dogs keep attacking my poor ducks. I don't know what to do,4594

4613,jealous,Man that gets to me when someone does that   like they are better than everyone else.,its not just that  this neighbor is always buying expensive things and likes to show them off,4613

4623,anxious,Yeah  I know what you mean it does sound very scary  but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out  they fill in the cavity! ,its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it.,4623

4640,devastated,I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.,Well then you will understand the love I had for my pitbull named Lily.   We had a special bond and when she died it broke my heart.  Never leave a candle burning and leave the house.   OUr house burned and she died of smoke inhalation.  I will never forget her!,4640
4641,terrified,That sounds super scary  could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?,Once during a snowstorm I had to go to the airport. My taxi driver decided that driving on the highway in the middle of nowhere late at night was the perfect time to tell me all about how he would kill a man,4641
4642,terrified,Oh wow  it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation. ,I shrank into myself and prayed for the car to go faster and not crash,4642

4664,annoyed,Aww man  that sucks  I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off. ,Yes! He is such a manchild! He does not care about cleanliness!,4664
4665,furious,Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.,I was so mad when my dog got my dinner off the table.,4665

4668,nostalgic,Mmhm. I wish I studied more  paid more attention  and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing  you're already as busy as it gets  and unfortunately you can't experience it all.,It was so great. We all just wanted to learn.,4668

4673,disgusted,Oh man  I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar. ,I was grossed out when I saw someone vomiting at a bar.,4673
4674,disgusted,Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight ,They couldn't even make it to the bathroom. Ugh.,4674

4930,prepared,True. There has to be a work/school/life balance. ,Yeah  but theres a balance. study too much and you just burn yourself out,4930
4931,caring,Well I hope he gets to felling better.,My dad got sick for a week and I stayed at home for a week taking care of him,4931
4932,caring,You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.,He's better already but he got a real bad fever during that week,4932
4933,guilty,That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.,I drank all the milk in the fridge and left nothing for anyone else. Next week I will buy extra milk for the house to make up for it.,4933
4934,guilty,Lol it happens  what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.,Yeah  I have done that before and I got yelled at by everyone. I learned my lesson. Haha,4934
4935,nostalgic,Awww  I never had one  but wanted one.,Looking through old stuff in the attic and stumbled across my old gamecube  sadly it didn't work anymore.,4935
4936,nostalgic,What were your favorite games?,Yeah i had good memories playing with my friends,4936
4937,furious,Wow  thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?,My old roommate didn't clean out his room or kitchen when he left. My school charged the rest of us $100 because of him.,4937
4938,furious,Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again  just loan them $20.,No  he cut off all communication. Nobody liked him anyways  he was dirty and rude.,4938
4939,disappointed,I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?,I was disappointed with the score of my final exam. I studied real hard but got a 64% on it.,4939
4940,disappointed,Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.,Yea i had a study group I just panicked when i entered the testing room i think. It's not so bad though  i still passed the class.,4940
4941,lonely,Aw  I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.,I live very far away from my family and I miss them dearly. I feel so alone sometimes.,4941
4942,lonely,That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.,Yes it is quite hard. But it has been my choice to move away. I guess one day I will return but not sure when.,4942
4943,embarrassed,Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.,One time in high school I sat in chocolate sauce! I didn't have a sweater to tie around my waste  so I had to borrow one from a friend.,4943
4944,embarrassed,Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!,One of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up. He really tried to embarrass me.,4944
4945,disgusted,Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?,Recently moved to a new dorm and when i came in the kitchen was a total disaster. Months old piles of dishes in the sink with mold and dried up old food on the stove.,4945
4946,disgusted,I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.,I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox  alcohol  and soap.,4946
4947,anxious,Did you pass?,When i was waiting for my final grade report to come in. I was scared i was going to fail my organic chem class.,4947
4948,anxious,Absolutely. Great job!,Yeah  got a 73% on the class. Not ideal but better than failing.,4948
4949,faithful,I completely agree  having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits,I have complete faith in my diet. It makes me feel great!,4949
4950,faithful,Yeah  and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!,It's easier to maintain than people realize!,4950
4951,terrified,Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?,I was driving down the highway during a heavy thunderstorm and two cars crashed in front of me and one flipped over.,4951
4952,terrified,Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok. ,Yeah im alright  i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos. The guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance  but he didn't look very injured. and the other guy was ok.,4952
4953,sad,Oh no  poor dog :( I'd be devastated too  i love dogs so much.,My dog died in my neighbors electrical fence last night. I am devastated!! I don't know what to do.,4953
4954,sad,Don't beat yourself up over it  it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now.,My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I feel so helpless that I could not save her. ,4954
4955,disgusted,That was nice of her. Did everything work out?,Recently  my wife and I needed a babysitter for the evening  and my mother-in-law offered to watch our kids.,4955
4956,disgusted,Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?,No  she forgot.  Which  unfortunately  is typical!,4956
4957,disgusted,Yeah I thought of that. well  the kids probably loved it!,Yeah  it worked out okay to take the kids with. It just wasn't quite as relaxing.,4957
4958,hopeful,Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?,I really enjoy collecting shoes  and i'm hoping to get a pair of Yeezy's that are restocking this october.,4958
4959,hopeful,Are they all Yeezys?,i have around 7 right now,4959
4960,grateful,That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?,I feel so happy to live out in the country. Nature is the most beautiful thing to experience everyday!,4960
4961,grateful,Yeah  that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!,Only about a 30 minute drive. Not to close and not to far. But we grow some of our food here and we have cows and chickens too.,4961
4962,joyful,Oh yes.  The first car is amazing,Back in highschool when i got my first car  i was so happy and drove it around for a while and it felt so nice being free to roam.,4962
4963,joyful,Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.,Yeah its a great feeling having someone thats yours.,4963
4964,annoyed,I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.,I feel anxious when I have to wait for people that are late. Why can't everyone just be on time?,4964
4965,annoyed,Yes  that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!,Yes totally agree! Maybe I should just leave and make them wait. Haha,4965
4966,guilty,I agree  it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?,It's really hard to stay disciplined and watch what you eat.,4966
4967,guilty,I've tried a few  and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on  and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.,I haven't done anything specific with diets  no.  Have you found one that you like?,4967
4968,surprised,That's so cool! Did they get you anything nice?,"""It was my birthday and my whole family threw a party for me after work. It was so unexpected!",4968
4969,surprised,Time to go shoppin lol!,They got me a bunch of gift cards to my favorite stores. They are all so wonderful. I love them so much!,4969
4970,ashamed,Aw Im sorry. Are you doing better now?,At the beginning of the year I missed a lot of work.  I was sick but I didnt feel like a team player at the time.,4970
4971,ashamed,That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely dodge a bullet by not getting it.,yeah I'm doing much better thanks.  I'll for sure be getting a flu shot next year!,4971
4972,ashamed,Glad you are doing better!,I have been lucky in the past but I dont remember the last time I have felt that sick. I definitely dont want to go through that again.,4972
4973,afraid,I feel you  but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation.,i have to go out of town  i am not looking forward to flying,4973
4974,afraid,I see  I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight  to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.,i keep telling myself flying is safe but I am petrified of getting on that plane,4974
4975,proud,That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.,My father has been such a great father. He is such a hard worker and loves his family so much. He is such a great man.,4975
4976,proud,Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.,Awww  yeah Daddy's can be the best! I wish all children could have good daddy's.,4976
4977,sentimental,I am sorry your dog passed away  I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?,I have a stuffed animal that my old dog used to lay by/on as a pillow. My dog is dead but I still keep that stuffed animal to remind me of him,4977
4978,sentimental,I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :),He was about 12.  He was my first dog though! He was a sweetheart.  It is nice keeping something to remind me of him.,4978
4979,devastated,Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?,I was hoping to get an interview for a higher position and was told I would get that at least.  However  the recruiter didnt look at internal candidates and by the time it was reported they had hired someone from the outside.,4979
4980,devastated,Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.,My boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates. It was a bummer but I figure I'll look for something else in the company soon,4980
4981,excited,Oh man  that is exciting! Do you know what kind?,I am getting a new car this week! I can't wait to smell the new leather seats!,4981
4982,excited,That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations  that's great news!,It's a beautiful 2018 yellow jeep! The car of my dreams! So stoked!,4982
4983,faithful,That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?,A bird fell out of a tree next to my house. I am now the mother and taking care of her. We are developing such a beautiful relationship.,4983
4984,faithful,Aww  I'd love to see a video of that.,I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.,4984
4985,trusting,You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.,I met a cow the other day and I went to go pet her. Something inside me told me to get away. Later that day the owner told me to stay away from her because she is known to attack people.,4985
4986,trusting,Good thing you listened to your gut feeling,Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.,4986
4987,apprehensive,Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.,I need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside. Not sure if I should go or not.,4987
4988,apprehensive,Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.,Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.,4988
4989,furious,Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?,i came home yesterday  i found my sofa torn up  let's say this I am not very  happy with my pet dog,4989
4990,furious,Yeah  I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.,i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it,4990
4991,devastated,Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself  animals like to play with each other!,I am so hurt that my baby goat died. My dogs were playing to rough and killer her. Man I should have stopped it sooner. It is all my fault. :(,4991
4992,devastated,That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.,Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.,4992
4993,joyful,That sounds great  I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?,I went fishing with my 4 year-old about a month ago.,4993
4994,joyful,Wow  that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.,He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.,4994
4995,caring,Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?,My dog was stung by a bug.  His lip got huge and looked really funny but I felt terrible for him!,4995
4996,caring,I bet he did  I'm glad he's okay though.,I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!,4996
4997,grateful,Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.,my best friend friend helped me through some rough spots with my marriage and job. I am gland he was there for me,4997
4998,grateful,I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.,thank you  i do not know how i will repay him back  I will always be in his debt,4998
4999,sentimental,I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.,I feel so bad to see so many homeless people on the streets these days. I hope I am never homeless.,4999
5000,sentimental,It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing,Yeah especially when it is snowing outside. Can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that . Oh! So sad!,5000
5001,content,That sounds fun! Where did you go?,I went out to eat with my girlfriend last week.  It was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!,5001
5002,content,Mmmmm  I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!,We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!,5002
5003,lonely,I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.,as I walk through my house  the rooms are empty  There is no one there for me,5003
5004,lonely,I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.,that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with,5004
5005,caring,What kinds of pets do you have?,I have no children but I have a ton of animals. I love them all so much. They are my children.,5005
5006,caring,oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.,I have chickens  ducks  parrots  cockatiels  budgies  peacocks  guinea pigs  dogs  goats and cows. haha ,5006
5007,afraid,Did he have superpowers?,When my son was born  we knew that something was up before he came out.  It was pretty scary.,5007
5008,afraid,That's pretty impressive.,Hah - no.  But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice  and he'd tied an overhand knot in it  too.,5008
5009,embarrassed,Oh wow  are you going to be in front of anyone important?,I was in a rush this morning and I dressed my self in stained clothes. I feel so dirty today. :(,5009
5010,embarrassed,Usually  you are the one who notices it the most. ,Not today. I just feel insecure about it  like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.,5010
5011,anticipating,wow  that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too  i presume.,My cows are finally pregnant. I can't wait for my baby calves to be born!,5011
5012,anticipating,very cool  wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun,Oh  yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.,5012
5013,sad,Awww  I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. ,i miss my old pet dog  i feel so empty without her around,5013
5014,sad,Maybe also looking into getting a new dog  I know it's hard  but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.,i know that what makes it harder not having her around  no companionship,5014
5015,jealous,That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!,I am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it.,5015
5016,jealous,Haha  that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. ,Yeah  maybe in my next life I guess  haha.,5016
5017,embarrassed,Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married,When I was in high school there was a senior I had a crush on and I was a sophomore.  I ended up asking her out but got rejected. Later on in college we actually became pretty good friends.,5017
5018,embarrassed,you dont still have any feelings at all for her?,Haha  I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her,5018
5019,confident,Ooh  I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!,I am learning how sew my own clothes. I am studying hard and I think I will be able to make my first outfit!,5019
5020,confident,Omg  that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.,Yes  I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own! ,5020
5021,prepared,Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. ,I just made a huge feast and now I am excited for all my guests to arrive to my baby shower!,5021
5022,prepared,Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.,Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.,5022
5023,trusting,Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! ,I trust the way my body feels to know if I'm generally healthy or not,5023
5024,trusting,It is  everything has to be balanced just right  or else we feel it.,Exactly! The human body is interesting!,5024
5025,furious,Oh no  how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. ,I went to a restaurant and after I got the bill I realized that I did not have my wallet on me! The manager was yelling at me demanding me to pay before I left.,5025
5026,furious,That is a tough spot to be in  maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. ,Yes  he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.,5026
5027,furious,That is good  such an embarrassing situation to be in.,I just left but I came straight back and paid. All was fine in the end. But I will never go to that restaurant again.,5027
5028,anticipating,Oh man I want that too! did you get it?,I really wanted an Oculus Rift.  I saved up enough and had to wait about a week before it was in stock at the store,5028
5029,anticipating,Do you use your computer?,I did!  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever bought!,5029
5030,anticipating,How much do they go for?,yeah  I have it plugged into my computer.  I cant tell you  or even begin to explain  how real everything feels when you use it.,5030
5031,anticipating,thats not bad. I have a rx 280 ,It was $400  having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece,5031
5032,impressed,Moving  is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?,I had to help my dad move some heavy stuff around this past weekend.,5032
5033,impressed,That's good  glad he wasn't having too tough a time.,Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well.,5033
5034,annoyed,Oh man  I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. ,my neighbor dog is always barking  I can't stand it,5034
5035,annoyed,That can make it so hard to sleep at night. ,i know the worst part is my bedroom is near the fence and the dog barks all night ,5035
5036,nostalgic,Aw man  childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. ,When I was a little girl my favorite childhood character was Strawberry Shortcake. I miss those days smelling my little figurines that smelled like strawberries.,5036
5037,nostalgic,Haha  clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! ,Yeah  I also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party. There were strawberries everywhere! I bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were  lol.,5037
5038,angry,Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?,my neighbor dog barks all day  I like to go over there and tell him where he can put that dog at ,5038
5039,angry,If it were me  I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.,that is the problem  he does nothing  except give me his little mustache smile  one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face,5039
5040,hopeful,Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.,I feel so sad to see the world in the state that it is in but I am confident that times are changing and humanity is actually good.,5040
5041,hopeful,Agreed!,Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.,5041
5042,sentimental,You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same  sadly. But so happy for you!,My childhood was great. I have mainly positive memories of it.,5042
5043,sentimental,I guess it all comes down to karma  if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :),Yeah life ends up pretty dark for tons of people. It's slightly absurd when you think far into it!,5043
5044,grateful,what did you end up doing?,I decided to try and get some projects knocked out a couple of nights ago  but needed to keep my kids occupied.,5044
5045,grateful,It's good to have a partner. ,Luckily  my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!,5045
5046,lonely,I have a son  it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.,My wife took the kids over to her mother's one evening before I got home from work.  I thought it'd be pretty nice to have a quiet house for once.,5046
5047,lonely,You must have been very happy when they returned home.,It was for a while  but it was too quiet for me!  I've gotten used to the noise.,5047
5048,sad,Did you get it?,I tried for a promotion at work recently.  It's been a while since I've gotten a raise  so I worked pretty hard at it.,5048
5049,sad,That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you. ,No  they ended up giving it to someone with less experience.,5049
5050,jealous,That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully  you did not lose too much.,I went to the casino with my brother and the only thing he could do was win! The only thing I could do was lose.,5050
5051,jealous,Yeah  but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.,Nope  I'm a little careful when I go out there.  It would have been nice to join in on the winning though!,5051
5052,confident,Hey  that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?,I interviewed for a job.  I know I gave great answers to their questions and walked away feeling like the job was mine.,5052
5053,confident,Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?,Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!,5053
5054,prepared,You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?,I work in tech support.  One issue I was given the details before and got to do research before I worked with the customer.  It was great knowing what to do before it happened.,5054
5055,prepared,That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!,yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.,5055
5056,proud,Oh  that's terrific! What a great feeling that is  to be appreciated and valued!,my girlfriend just got promoted at her job. I am really glad for her.,5056
5057,proud,Oh  I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!,i knew she could and would get the promotion  i feel like i am going to burst ,5057
5058,furious,I also have two older puppies  training takes time and care and love.,I have been working on potty training my dog and she has been doing great! Last night though she went a TON in the house right after I brought her out.,5058
5059,furious,Puppies are smart believe it or not  use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.,It definitely does!  I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.,5059
5060,nostalgic,i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.,I was packing up things to move from my girlfriends house and found her son's lite brite.  It reminded me of my childhood and playing with that toy.,5060
5061,nostalgic,i agree  the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. ,It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!,5061
5062,hopeful,Moving can be stressful for sure  hopefully you had some help?,I had a move a couple weekends ago.  I was really planning on getting everything done  or at least moved over  in one weekend.,5062
5063,hopeful,It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. ,yeah  the help was great and we did end up getting everything over.  Now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!,5063
5064,disappointed,That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?,I had a great weekend with my son  we did a ton of fun things.  At the end of the weekend his attitude changed and he didnt want to listen at all.,5064
5065,disappointed,I bet that worked!,I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time,5065
5066,disgusted,Oh man  i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.,My dog went number 2 in the middle of the night inside.  The next morning she threw up everything...it was the worst smelling pile of stuff I've ever smelled.,5066
5067,disgusted,I bet  hope the dog is feeling better though.,Sorry about that! Yeah  it was a terrible thing to wake up to!,5067
5068,disgusted,interesting  what was the issue?,I used to have a boxer puppy that was so sweet and adorable.  HOwever he had on issue that I could not stand.,5068
5069,disgusted,oh man  that is an issue  i hope he grows out of it,Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.   HOwever he would then eat it!!!!!

5079,terrified,I've never tried VR  but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.,It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary,5079

5092,sentimental,Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.,Today I was looking through my childhood photos and writings  it made me a little emotional and nostalgic.,5092
5093,sentimental,Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.,I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.,5093
5094,ashamed,That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience  right?,I slept through a really important class because I was hungover and I failed because of it. I should've behaved better.,5094
5095,ashamed,No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.,I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that  I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.,5095
5096,caring,That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!,I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible. ,5096
5097,caring,Yes  it really does. I am sure if you get sick  he will remember and do the same for you!,He did  he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick  it helps to have someone to care for you.,5097

5117,devastated,Wow  how was it? I have never seen that trailer. ,I saw the movie trailer about Paul Walker's life today. It made me so sad!,5117
5118,devastated,Aww  that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! ,It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.,5118

5121,embarrassed,Oh  I'm sorry. What happened?,The other day something happened that made me want to run and hide.,5121
5122,embarrassed,I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.,It didn't happen to me directly  but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.,5122
5123,guilty,I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? ,My girlfriend and I were watching a series on Netflix.  She wasnt home and I ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at.,5123
5124,guilty,Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you  even if you had already watched them. ,She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean  I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!,5124

5129,confident,Was it a lot of fun?,I went to a friend's wedding this weekend!,5129

5136,furious,Why is that?,I really need to change doctors!,5136
5137,furious,Wow  that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.,He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name,5137
5138,afraid,I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.,I was playing a VR game home alone.  It took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game.,5138
5139,afraid,That would keep me up at night.,It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.,5139
5140,ashamed,Oh my gosh that's insane. Well  I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. ,yesterday i ate a whole big bag of M&Ms  i don't feel proud of myself,5140
5141,ashamed,I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. ,i hope so  i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed,5141
5142,impressed,Aww  sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.,We recently got a new puppy. My older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first.,5142
5143,impressed,Yeah  sounds like a pretty smart pup.,It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.,5143
5144,proud,I do understand  I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.,We've been really struggling with potty training my son.,5144
5145,proud,That is awesome. I am proud of him ,Thanks  we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night  though!,5145
5146,faithful,gotta risk it for the biscuit,I went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls. One asked for my number but I told her I have a girlfriend and didnt give it out.,5146
5147,faithful, i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping,Haha  I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.,5147
5148,apprehensive,It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine  though! Have confidence!,i have a presentation due this week  I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others,5148
5149,apprehensive,You know they say  imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.,i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others,5149
5150,disappointed,Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?,I felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work. It just makes me more motivated to work harder.,5150
5151,disappointed,I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure  at least if you have a good boss  they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.,Yes  I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(,5151
5152,lonely,Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!,My roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house. I dont remember the last time I lived without any roommates.,5152
5153,lonely,Yeah  but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up  your girlfriend will be there soon!,It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.,5153
5154,content,Oh I know  mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.,I feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and I can take the time to watch and relax. It is the best time of the day for me.,5154
5155,content,It reminds you of how beautiful life is.,Yeah  it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.,5155
5156,faithful,Wow  that's rude! He won't last long...,Man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad.,5156
5157,faithful,Yeah  some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!,I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.,5157
5158,anxious,Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?,My sister is having another baby! I can't wait to meet her! This will be her fourth child.,5158
5159,anxious,LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!,Only one more month to go. She is about the explode though! Glad it is her and not me  lol.,5159
5160,anxious,You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.,Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha,5160
5161,apprehensive,I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary,There was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning.  He didn't look mean but I wasn't sure I wanted to mess with him.,5161
5162,apprehensive,I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.,It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.,5162
5163,ashamed,Oh  no. Did you take it back or keep it,I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store.,5163
5164,ashamed,The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. ,I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.,5164
5165,sentimental,That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?,So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions.,5165
5166,sentimental,I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.,My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.,5166
5167,devastated,Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry  I know you must feel like crap.,So I lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country.  We had matching ones made and it's really breaking my heart.,5167
5168,devastated,I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.,It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.,5168
5169,excited,Sweet! Where did you go?,We had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago.,5169
5170,excited,That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!,We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!,5170
5171,annoyed,I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?,I work in tech support.  Every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for.,5171
5172,annoyed,Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?,I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.,5172
5173,trusting,oh no! hope all is well with your dog.,I had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and I had full confidence they would take care of his problems. They are so good there.,5173
5174,trusting,Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. ,Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.,5174
5175,content,BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?,So we went out to that new BBQ place to eat the other night.  ,5175
5176,content,Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.,It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange. ,5176
5177,surprised,i completely agree. though  i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;),I really loathe meetings.  They're usually so pointless.,5177
5178,surprised,lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. ,That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However  I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!,5178
5179,embarrassed,That's terrible! What did you do?,Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!,5179
5180,embarrassed,That's good. I'm glad your alright.,I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.,5180
5181,embarrassed,Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. ,Once in Kindergarten  a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom.,5181
5182,embarrassed,Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you,I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble,5182
5183,sentimental,What kind of car was it?,the other day I was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own. I miss that car.,5183
5184,sentimental,Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it,i was an old Cadillac  reason I miss it  lot of memories of family and friends riding in it,5184
5185,devastated,OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass  or missing?,i just lost my pet dog. I do not know what to do.,5185
5186,devastated,I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.,i cannot find her anywhere  she is missing  it feels like I have a part of me missing ,5186
5187,confident,Good job! How do you think you did on it?,It was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam  knowing I was prepared.,5187
5188,confident,That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!,I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.,5188
5189,prepared,Yeah I like going straight to the point too,I packed for a long road trip  and had everything I would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops. ,5189
5190,prepared,I like when I get places earlier than expected,Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.,5190
5191,anxious,I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?,I had a dentist appointment yesterday.  I hate going to the dentist!,5191
5192,anxious,That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!,Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.,5192
5193,angry,Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?,My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room.,5193
5194,angry,Ugh  that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!,He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.,5194
5195,proud,That is wonderful! You must be happy  shows that he is getting bigger  soon it will be college ,My son graduated pre-school.  It isnt much but its that next step in his school career.,5195
5196,proud,College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.,Haha  I hope not too soon!  I was really happy  he is growing pretty fast!,5196
5197,excited,That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind,I'm going to a beer dabbler this weekend.  It has been very busy the last couple weeks so I'm really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend.,5197
5198,excited,I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.,I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!,5198
5199,sad,That must be hard to do  he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.,I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights,5199
5200,sad,Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.,I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!,5200
5201,caring,That is so sweet. What is her name?,i do love my pet doggy  she is a treat to have,5201
5202,caring,I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs  I would like to have a dog someday.,Angie  i like to give her a warm bath  dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat,5202
5203,surprised,That is very cute  the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. ,We just got a new puppy.  My older dog knew to let that one out first when I got home from work.,5203
5204,surprised,That was very smart of him  maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.,Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!,5204
5205,trusting,That's good. How is it going?,I used to have my dog in his crate when I left for work.  Lately I have been letting him out more and more in the house when I've been gone.,5205
5206,trusting,That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom  and was ready for it. ,It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.,5206
5207,terrified,I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?,I was driving down the road and I almost hit a dog! I was so close. Really scary!,5207
5208,terrified,I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.,Yes  he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.,5208
5209,guilty,lol  guess you were pretty hungry,I finished all the ice cream when I was told to leave some for others. I was just so hungry!,5209
5210,guilty,yeah  might wanna go replace it,Yeah  now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha,5210
5211,joyful,That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?,I am the happiest in my life when I am at the ocean. There is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me.,5211
5212,joyful,Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.,I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool! ,5212
5213,impressed,i sure it was beautiful,I saw Dubai from the airplane one day. I never went into the city  but wow  it was a sight to see!,5213
5214,impressed,really  i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment,It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi. Almost scary actually.,5214
5215,disgusted,yuck  how gross!!,I found out that my neighbors eat turtle meat. How gross!!!,5215

5247,sentimental,Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.,Very often I get very emotional when things go wrong. I think more emotional than most people.,5247
5248,sentimental,I go to a psychiatrist and take meds  It just fixes what your body doesn't make  or do properly. It helps so much. ,I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.,5248
5249,devastated,Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!,I made a stupid mistake at work and I got fired. What am I going to do?,5249
5250,devastated,Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.,Yeah  I feel really bad though. It is such a terrible feeling to be rejected like that.,5250

5257,confident,I 'm glad to here it will be fine   but what was wrong with it?,My dog has been really sick this past week but after going to the vet I truly think he will be just fine,5257
5258,confident,I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.,He want really weak and had a fever. It was because of an allergy that gave him a severe skin infection.,5258

5263,anticipating,The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.,i applied for a job promotion. But i won't know if i got it or not until next week,5263
5264,anticipating,Things like that make me antsy.,i know  im having trouble concentrating at work  I just want to know right now,5264

5268,nostalgic,Haha! Well  as we mature  we learn so much more about ourselves.,My aspirations when I was younger. We had a good laugh when I read in one of my old journals that I wanted to be a teacher when earlier that day I had stated that I couldn't imagine being a teacher now.,5268
5269,terrified,Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!,I went to Six FLags once with my daughters.   I didnt want to go as I hate to ride roller coasters and am scared of heights.,5269
5270,terrified,Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;),I am a mother not a father silly.  Yes I made it through all right  but thought I was going to die!!   THey had me ride the ferris wheel and I was crying as they were laughing at me.,5270
5271,furious,Oh no! So what did you do?!,Today before work when I went to brush my teeth  there was no toothpaste left. My boyfriend used it all!,5271
5272,furious,That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath  right?,I was so angry  I had to leave for work very soon. I ended up just asking a neighbor to borrow some. I didn't have anytime to buy any before work. I couldn't afford to be late.,5272
5273,guilty,Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?,I once had a party when I was a teenager.  My parents were out of town.,5273
5274,guilty,Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.,Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol  so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.,5274
5275,jealous,Wow  cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?,i envy my sister  she is going on vacation in Paris,5275
5276,jealous,That's too bad. Well  at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.,I will be at work  maybe next time,5276

5283,ashamed,Do you feel nice and refreshed though?,i was upset at myself for sleeping in so late this morning,5283
5284,ashamed,I did the same thing today  so you are not alone in your behavior friend!,yes definitely!,5284
5285,devastated,Oh no! Did it break?,I dropped my iPod touch on the bathroom floor.,5285
5286,devastated,Oh  that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.,Unfortunately yes. The screen shattered and I went for over a month without music.,5286
5287,caring,Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?,My guinea pig was feeling very sick but I was able to nurse her back to health.,5287
5288,caring,Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!,No  I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now!,5288
5289,trusting,That is good  how long did it take before you go him to this point?,After training my dog I feel confident now that he can be around others dogs without fighting.,5289
5290,trusting,Yeah i understand  it is good that you took him there though,It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.,5290
5291,jealous,Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?,my next door neighbor just bought a Mercedes  I wish i can have one.,5291
5292,jealous,sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. ,really cannot afford one  but the neighbor can  he is always buying expensive stuff  last month he bought a speed boat.,5292
5293,disappointed,Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment,Last week I had a argument with my son  he really said some mean things to me. I thought I raised him better.,5293
5294,disappointed,well maybe you guys should talk,It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.,5294
5295,disgusted,Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.,My roommate cooked some really foul smelling meat last night  I had to leave or I was going to puke.,5295
5296,disgusted,Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now,Exactly! I had to air out the place for a couple hours after.,5296
5297,embarrassed,Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. ,I used the restroom at a nice restaurant and I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn't know it until I left. ,5297
5298,embarrassed,Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol,Yeah  I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha,5298
5299,anticipating,I am with you  i like it a lot more than summer personally,I am probably one of the few people in the world that looks forward to winter coming.,5299
5300,anticipating,I feel that  I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold  but in the summer it is not that easy.,I can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful. I love winter clothes and all the winter holidays.,5300
5301,anxious,I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.,When you took your driver's test were you nervous?,5301
5302,anxious,Did you pass the test?,I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time. I was so anxious!,5302
5303,jealous,I am the same way  I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know,Sometimes I feel envious of those that have money than I do.,5303
5304,jealous,I think cities are more expensive  like living costs  so I do not want to live there ether personally,Yeah  and it seems so hard to make money these days  at least for me. Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.,5304
5305,trusting,I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.,i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time,5305
5306,trusting,Oh  I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?,i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over,5306

5310,terrified,at least your ok  thank god for that,I am but I still think about how things could've been so much different right now if I hadn't swerved just at the right moment.,5310
5311,confident,Nice  for what position,there is an upcoming promotion at my job  I am sure i'm going to get it.,5311
5312,confident,That's pretty great  you must really take the initiative.  Good job,as a supervisor. I feel that all of my hard work and skill has given me the inside track for this position,5312
5313,prepared,You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning  and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.,I have all my ingredients for my dinner party and now I am getting ready to prepare a feast!,5313
5314,prepared,"I think  maybe  yeah! It depends on who's there  and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of ""rescue me"" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers  then that'd be alright. Other than that  I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4  max",Yeah  we all have different personalities. But you would come to a dinner party if invited  right?,5314
5315,guilty,Aw  that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.,I broke one of my mom's crystal figurine  I tried hard not to tell her but in the end I felt so bad I had to tell her.,5315
5316,guilty,Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.,Yes  she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though. ,5316
5317,content,I am right there with you!  God is good and wow  He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.,I feel happy to know that God has got my back and I don't have to worry about anything.,5317
5318,content,Yes  we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!,Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.,5318
5319,nostalgic,They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.,I miss how we all used to celebrate Christmas when I was a child. It was such a warm and cozy time. Things are really changing in this high tech modern world.,5319
5320,nostalgic,Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!,Yeah  so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between. I still have some videos of recordings from the 80's. ,5320
5321,caring,Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?,In July  I found a large moth inside a cottage that my brother and friends were staying at.,5321
5322,caring,I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!,It was as big as a small bird  I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over. I caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!,5322
5323,joyful,What is your nieces name?,My sister gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl last week! I was so happy to meet my niece.,5323

5325,hopeful,It will be amazing!  I should do that too!,I planted a whole bunch of flower bushes this year. I cannot wait until next spring when my entire garden will be in bloom with so many wonderful colors and smells.,5325
5326,hopeful,That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!,Yes! I just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from. I made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell. I am dreaming of all the flower arrangements I will make next year.,5326
5327,content,That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.,After feeling depressed for days  I took the time to sit outside in the sun and have a nice chit chat with my mom.,5327
5328,content,I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!,Thank you for your kind words  it means a lot really. And yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting  it completely changed my mood!,5328
5329,afraid,I imagine  are you prepared for it?,There may be a hurricane in my area soon I am kind of scared.,5329
5330,afraid,Oh yes  last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.,Not yet  but I will start preparing. I am worried we may lose power or our house may flood.,5330
5331,sentimental,Aw  did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?,i felt nostalgiac going through old childhood belongings,5331
5332,sentimental,That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.,yes definitely  it was great,5332
5333,ashamed,I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.,i forgot to pay my credit card bill  I'm so disappointed with myself.,5333
5334,ashamed,I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.,Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.,5334
5335,prepared,That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?,i have a presentation tomorrow. I am ready for it.,5335
5336,prepared,Good luck! You will do great!,for the past two weeks I have bee working on it and this week I have been practicing it ,5336
5337,embarrassed,Haha  I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed  but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens  since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.,I once called my girlfriend's mother mom by accident.,5337
5338,embarrassed,Yeah  she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes  while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously  which it sounds like maybe you did.,Exactly  especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.,5338
5339,furious,That's gross  why are they coming in?,The pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place!,5339
5340,furious,You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.,Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.,5340
5341,disappointed,I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you  it is very sad.,Oh  I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days?,5341
5342,disappointed,Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.,Family should come first  right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!,5342
5343,impressed,I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.,Recently I had a very good customer service experience with my cable company. Not only did they fix the problem they gifted me free premium content for a year!,5343
5344,impressed,I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!,That's so funny! I was so surprised too but really happy. I might even pay for the services when my free year is up.,5344
5345,disgusted,Oh  wow! That is crazy  have you talked to the vet?,My dog eats other animals poop. I have seen them eat goat  duck and cow poop. I hope they don't get sick.,5345
5346,disgusted,I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. ,The vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that I give them their worm pills regularly. ,5346
5347,terrified,Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!,Last night there was a terrible thunderstorm. I unplugged all my computers and electronics. Then there was a loud bang and I heard my electrical box make a loud click. I think my house was electrocuted!,5347
5348,terrified,That is a good lesson to learn early  I am glad everything turned out okay for you!,Yeah! I learned my lesson from experience. We get pretty crazy storms out here. ,5348
5349,anxious,That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol,I cannot wait until the weekend is here! I'm going skydiving for the first time!,5349
5350,anxious,I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience,I am not nervous yet but I for sure will be when it's time to jump out of that plane! Oh  what am I getting myself into  lol.,5350
5351,guilty,Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?,When I was a kid I used to steal candy from the local 7/11 with my brother. We never got caught from the store but my parents found all the wrappers hiding in our room.,5351
5352,guilty,Haha did they believe it?,Yes  they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha,5352
5353,trusting,nice  what system do you play on?,A friend borrowed some video games of mine,5353
5354,trusting,i really enjoy video games as well,Xbox primarily  I'm hoping he'll get everything back in one piece,5354
5355,furious,That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?,I cannot stand my neighbor's dog's barking  its never ending,5355
5356,furious,You might try contacting the authorities  though I don't know if it would help. ,i have  that what makes me so mad  he just smiles at me while I tell him and he does not do anything about it,5356
5357,sentimental,thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family,I found some of my old toys that I had passed down to my younger brother today while cleaning up his closet.,5357
5358,sentimental,did he enjoy the toys>,It really was! It brought back so many wonderful and touching memories.,5358
5359,anticipating,Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?,The first time my girlfriend invited me to her father's house  I was super anxious.,5359
5360,anticipating,That is good! Are you guys close now>,He mostly speaks French  and although I understand it perfectly I have trouble speaking. In the end it went well  and he was super easy-going and made me feel like family.,5360
5361,confident,Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?,I spent hours reviewing notes and course content to prepare myself for a few trials that a company wanted me to go through.,5361

5363,confident,Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :),In a way yes and no. I'm teaching online  and my major in University is Education at the moment. So it helps me in school  and looks good on a CV for a full-time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future.,5363
5364,confident,My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.,Thank you for appreciating teachers!,5364
5365,jealous,Man.. i need some of that luck!,My friend is so lucky  he always seems to be winning lotteries and gambles of sorts.,5365

5368,impressed,For sure you are born with those types of talents!,It is really fun to create things  anyone can do it! But talent I think is a gift from God.,5368
5369,nostalgic,That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!,i was channel surfing and ran across the old Batman tv show  brought back memories.,5369
5370,nostalgic,I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. ,same here  I loved watching Batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it.,5370
5371,ashamed,that must have been embarrassing  I hope you weren't to traumatized,When I was a little girl I would have to wear shoes with holes in it to school. Everyone made fun of me all the time. My family could not afford much.,5371
5372,ashamed,that is good to hear  it was a motivation to succeed  a great character building ,I think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that I will never have to be in that place again.,5372
5373,devastated,Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.,i was sad to see my favorite tree had been broken in the storm last week,5373
5374,devastated,How big was it?,it was pretty bad but i think the tree was already dying,5374
5375,afraid,You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest. ,I am very fearful of dying. I know it will come one day  I just hope and pray it doesn't hurt so bad.,5375
5376,afraid,Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it. ,Yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media.,5376
5377,trusting,That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?,Last week I really had to rely on my friend to keep his word.,5377

5381,sentimental,Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?,Last month cleaning out the attic I found a old box of photo albums that had belonged to my mother.,5381
5382,sentimental,Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you. ,So many good pictures. It was great reliving all of those old memories  many I had forgotten about.,5382
5383,disappointed,Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?,I just got a new haircut  lets say this  I do not like it.,5383
5384,disappointed,That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back. ,no  same style from my barber who always cuts my hair  for some reason he did a terrible job,5384
5385,disgusted,Ohhhh  disgusting.  What did you do?,yesterday  i was drinking a glass of milk. When i put the glass back down  a fly was swimming in the milk,5385
5386,disgusted,I bet  what a terrible feeling!,first i did not know what it was  than i realized it was a fly  i was about to throw up,5386
5387,disgusted,Oh man  your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.,i know  flies are filthy creatures  and plus they produce maggots  yuck,5387
5388,anxious,is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?,i have to give a presentation on Monday  I don't think I'm ready,5388
5389,anxious,yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better,i think i'm ready but it is the waiting  to give it   I just want it to be over,5389
5390,apprehensive,Oh my  I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.,A few of my co-workers said they'd be absent next week,5390
5391,apprehensive,Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!,Yeah  I hope we don't get a ton of work while they're gone,5391
5392,terrified,Yeah  flying can be scary.,I have to take a plane trip next week  I'm not looking forward to it and I have to take a plane trip next week  I'm not looking forward to it.,5392
5393,terrified,Hopefully it isn't a long flight.,i know  just the idea of being in a plane up in the sky  scares the bejesus out of me,5393
5394,trusting,thats awesome that you trust her,I left my young daughter with my friend. I totally trust her though  she will be a great mom someday!,5394
5395,trusting,its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays,yeah she is a great person.  she is a little younger than me.,5395
5396,sentimental,Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?,One time my cat got ran over by a car,5396
5397,sentimental,Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.,No  it was some person driving recklessly!,5397
5398,devastated,That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. ,Last year during the spring  our area got record rainfall. My basement ended up getting flooded and destroying many of my childhood things and keepsakes.,5398
5399,devastated,Yeah  I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things  but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them  I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch  because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.,It really is  it just sucks losing all of those things. They were like my connection to the past.,5399
5400,content,Oh man  thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.,I am at peace with myself after taking a nice hot shower,5400
5401,content,It's such a wonderful feeling  I should take a shower soon too.,Yes! I feel like a new person!,5401
5402,sad,How did you you go over your budget?,what kind of saturday is this  i mean sure it's a relaxing one but damn i really blew it on the budget plan,5402

5407,surprised,Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.,just greedy? more than that  who the hell finishes a whole 500g of coffee in 3 days !,5407
5408,proud,yea i have,have you ever had that one person who never ever disappoints you?,5408
5409,proud,thats great  happy for yo,me too  she's recently going through a lot and despite all that  she's working hard everyday for us and i am just so happy and lucky to have her,5409
5410,lonely,literally me right now actually,ever just feel so isolated in a room and alone? what a weird day,5410
5411,lonely,must be nice to have someone that loves you,same  it's just such a slow day too  but one thing that is making me hopeful is tht next week i am going to travel to see fiance,5411
5412,ashamed,What is going on with your work?,...i am truly utterly worthless  i couldn't even submit my work on time,5412
5413,ashamed,You can do better next time I believe in you!,i had an assignment to submit but i didn't submit it on time  i am so disappointed in myself ,5413

5415,faithful,Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.,because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!,5415
5416,apprehensive,its not so bad  it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there,tomorrow is my first university day and i'm very nervous,5416
5417,apprehensive,once you figure the way it just becomes routine,i hope i won't get lost but i'm so bad with that  i always get lost. ,5417
5418,trusting,You are so right  did you read that somewhere?,whenever you feel so hopeless  so distance and you feel like nothing ever matters  just remember to trust in the universe  for it has a plan for you,5418
5419,trusting,That is cool  have you studied any philosophy in school?,no  i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma ,5419
5420,content,Yes  I feel that every day.,do you ever just feel so grateful that you're alive?,5420
5421,content,I wish people understood how precious life really is.,it's the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything.,5421
5422,devastated,Why did you throw your laptop?,i threw my laptop the other day and i already regret it,5422
5423,devastated,Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.,because i was very pissed off  i wasn't able to work .,5423
5424,devastated,wow thats vivid  what game was this?,3-3  final game decides it all  final game till promotion  time ticking  palms sweating  final minute and just as we are about to win it all  to finally reach that noble masters rank  my team mate fails to make the correct decision and we lose  it all just crumbles to the ground like rocks falling from the sky  my dream gone ,5424
5425,devastated,ah yes league  love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more,league of legends  my other addiction  other than my fiance ,5425
5426,embarrassed,Oh no  I hope it wasn't an important meeting.,i was super late for my meeting on tuesday   i got so embarrassed ,5426
5427,embarrassed,Sorry to hear that  were they understanding about it?,it was actually  and because of the traffic i couldn't make it,5427
5428,caring,I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?,my wife has been very sick recently and i am making the soup that is famous with our family recipe and she is slowly getting better,5428
5429,caring,That sounds quite delicious if I must say.,it's called lentil soup and we make it a special way with cumin spice and love ,5429
5430,sentimental,Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  ,ever feel so full of emotions when looking at old pictures?,5430
5431,sentimental,Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!,for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia  when you get sad  happy and sentimental ,5431
5432,apprehensive,Yikes  that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.,i am just so scared of what is going to happen in the future  i need to make money  have a house  own a car  and other materialistic good because  i am a person of the 21st century and i cannot afford any of this so i need to get a job  but all these jobs are paying me next to nothing despite my masters degree in computer science  what to do?,5432
5433,apprehensive,Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.,ummm? excuse me? do you know people earn a lot from computer science  it is not my degree for sure  it's this corrupt world we live in that's the problem,5433
5434,content,Life is the most beautiful thing.,life is beautiful isn't it?,5434
5435,content,I live every day like it's my last.,are you happy with the way things are? i am enjoying every second,5435
5436,jealous,Waiting in line is the worst.,i hate when that happens  i was suppose to be the on who was first  who was suppose to go first in the line  but instead my friend ended up going first,5436
5437,jealous,I hope you got your classes.,but it was in the line for university classes  i am so jealous ,5437
5438,confident,Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!,i feel like there is nothing that i can't do  i feel so powerful!  and smart! i just implemented a kmeans algorithm with my own method  ,5438
5439,confident,I agree that it is as well. In most situations  it can work to one's benefit.,yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have,5439
5440,furious,I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?,feelsbadman  some one in this absurd family ! WHO KEEPS ON TAKING MY BLOODY SHOES! ,5440
5441,furious,Why would they want to do that?,no  i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry,5441
5442,nostalgic,I can imagine the flood of emotions.,it sure does bring back a lot of fond memories as you go for a walk past your old neighbourhood ,5442
5443,nostalgic,I hope it was worth visiting.,yup  many memories from the past  the good  the bad,5443
5444,prepared,Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!,pen  check  notepad  check! i am going to kill this social event today! i am going to leave 30mins earlier too,5444
5445,prepared,I would love to come with you to yours. LOL  I just invited myself.,i'll sure do that  it's going to be fun too  do you go to social events?,5445
5446,disappointed,I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.,i don't know how to feel  i've been working so hard the past few months but i feel like i am not getting anywhere  still at the same place as i was ,5446
5447,disappointed,Are you looking for a new job?,maybe  but i also need a plan because if i continue like this  i won't get anywhere for reals,5447
5448,anxious,That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?,can i really do everything alone? i just feel so useless,5448
5449,anxious,I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online? ,no  i don't like people  they make me lose more hope in the plane,5449
5450,disgusted,ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??,last week my friends and i ordered pizza while at their house  after an hour of eating the pizza i pucked everywhere on his couch  i feel so bad and grossed out,5450
5451,disgusted,He seems like a good friend.  ,god knows what was in that pizza  but i helped clean and the mess was still showing  but he said it wasn't a problem ,5451
5452,terrified,The future certainly can be scary.,... everything seems to be everywhere  i am just scared out of my mind of the future,5452
5453,terrified,I am curious for what the future holds.,are you not scared of the future?,5453
5454,guilty,Oh wow  the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?,my mother got a big cake and left it in the fridge for us to eat later  i selfishly took it all upstairs and closed my door and ate all of it while watching anime,5454
5455,guilty,If you can and have time  I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.,she hasn't yet  we're suppose to have it later tonight  but how disappointed she'll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me... ,5455
5456,joyful,Oh cool.  How does it work?,i created this math formula yesterday for uniquely identifying words! and i am so happy with myself,5456
5457,joyful,Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.  ,it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number  then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :P,5457
5458,jealous,Oh man  I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn? ,i never got the chance to get promoted at work even though all my colleagues did!,5458
5459,jealous,I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!,i am envying them. i don't know   i'm working very hard as well.,5459
5460,caring,That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important,i care a lot about my family and always want them to be happy,5460
5461,caring,I agree!  ,family should always come first. ,5461
5462,prepared,ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?,i am very ready for my first semester in university!,5462
5463,prepared,yeah defiantly  my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   ,i am really hoping i can make some good friends  and just learn about everything i don't know a lot about you know?,5463
5464,furious,what? what happend? why are you angry?,i was very angry when i learned about what happened,5464
5465,furious,really? was it about something very stupid?,i'm angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren't talking together. that made me very mad.,5465
5466,confident,I think that's a kind of natural reaction  especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.,I play guitar as a hobby but rarely play in front of other guitarists.  I only feel comfortable doing it if the people around me play worse or not at all.,5466
5467,confident,Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.,Exactly!  I always feel there's less chance of embarrassment if you're the best in the room.,5467
5468,anticipating,that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?,i'm looking forward to next week  i'm going on a holiday with my fiance!,5468
5469,anticipating,that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to,well  we are going to turkey! i've heard some good things about that country i'm very excited,5469
5470,hopeful,That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.,i have a lot of hope for the future. i'm going to get married soon  and everything is going to be amazing!,5470
5471,hopeful,I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.,isn't it? i don't see negative things in life  i try to always look at the bright side.,5471
5472,disappointed,what did he do yolo?,i am sad because my brother failed me.,5472
5473,disappointed,this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!,he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.,5473
5474,disgusted,Oh  yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?,my brother was sick and he puked in front of me  it smelled horrible,5474
5475,disgusted,that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.,i didn't  but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(,5475
5476,anxious,don't be! i know this is overused but trust me  it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be  if you focus and aim for your goals  you will get it! i know you can do it!,i am moving out of this country soon and i'm worried about my university  because i'll have a lot of exams to do and not gonna lie i'm stressed out.,5476
5477,anxious,don't be  i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out,that was very needed   thank you so much  i was really stressed because of it.,5477
5478,terrified,It really is  what can we do to help?,global warming is terrifying me. and i'm scared people aren't even realising it.,5478
5479,terrified,That'd be a good idea  we could all start biking.,i don't know maybe starting by stop using all those cars ? i don't know i wish we could do something.,5479
5480,confident,What was the project?1,i just delivered the best project at work! ,5480
5481,confident,You must be an expert on nutrition then!,the project that i worked on was to deliver a marketing speech for healthy eating,5481
5482,hopeful,What are you looking forward too?,i am so hopeful for the future! ,5482
5483,hopeful,Which country? that sounds fun  are you guys doing anything fun there?,i am going to see my fiance who lives in adifferent country ,5483
5484,anticipating,yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items,i am travelling soon  but i am bringing with myself a lithium ion battery for phone replacement to the airport security  i am anticipating the security there so i may talk to the person at the desk to confirm i can take such an item,5484
5485,anticipating,yes. hopefully all will go well,the website says yes! but my friends say they don't know if that's accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there,5485
5486,joyful,Are you his best man?,i am very happy  my best friend is getting married today,5486
5487,joyful,I hope he does  being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.,well   i consider him my brother  i don't know if he thinks the same  we grew up together.,5487
5488,impressed,sounds quite interesting to code,at work i ended up writing code that is able to detect words that are similar and detect their meaning and cluster them into groups of n clusters ,5488
5489,impressed,oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming,it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k-means and neural netwroking,5489
5490,afraid,What happened?,i am nervous and scared of my feelings  i feel like in the future they will hurt me,5490

5492,nostalgic,That's good! I hope you had a good time?,i saw one of my old friends today,5492
5493,nostalgic,Yes  it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time. ,well it brought back a lot of memories  and it felt nice to see her after all those years.,5493
5494,grateful,What are you planning on doing with it?,so greatful to be given this wonderful life,5494
5495,grateful,That sounds so admirable  I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.,build a life with my fiance and grow together and gain more and more knowledge ,5495

5508,proud,Yeah  we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!,Sometimes I feel very happy that I am a US resident. When I travel to other countries everyone is so amazed that I am from the US. They treat you very differently because they think that the US is so great  rich and free.,5508

5512,surprised,You were probably just being you.,I was so happy to come home the other day and everything was clean and dinner was already on the table. What did I do to deserve that?,5512
5513,surprised,Haha! That's usually the case. : ),No  I think somebody wants something... I am just waiting to hear it  lol.,5513
5514,lonely,I understand. Is your family living far from New York?,I lived in New York City for a couple of years and it is definitely a place where one can feel quite alone if you don't have family or friends.,5514
5515,lonely,It is always cool to have family and friends close by.,Yes  a plane ride away. But there was also a lot of cool things to see. I think it was a good experience but it would be better with friends and family.,5515
5516,faithful,That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!,When I am in nature I feel good that this world is exactly as it should be. Everything is moving along to Gods plans.,5516
5517,faithful,Why do cities make you feel that way?,Yes  when I am in nature. :) But when I come to the big cities I feel like it is the devils playgrounds,5517
5518,ashamed,Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas. , feel so bad  I forgot again to fill the gas tank up in the car after I used it all. My friend is going to kill me!,5518
5519,ashamed,You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! ,I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.,5519
5520,guilty,Did you give it back or just walk away?,just got back from grocery shopping  The cashier gave me back $10 more change than I supposed to get,5520
5521,guilty,Yeah  that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.,i did not find out untill i got home  the store is kind of far and I think I'm going to keep it  but it's eating on my conscious because of that,5521
5522,apprehensive,I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place. ,I feel a little weird about looking at this house for sale. It looks haunted and I think something bad happened there  but not sure.,5522
5523,apprehensive,Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it! ,That is a good idea. It is such good deal and I think it would not need much money to fix it up. But a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!,5523
5524,sentimental,I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.,When bad things happen I get too emotional. I think more than other do. Sometimes I think I am crazy.,5524
5525,sentimental,Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.,Yeah  I know. But in the moment it is hard. I guess I am just a very emotional person. Maybe I need theraoy  lol.,5525
5526,trusting,Maybe it isnt your body  but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from  but none the less it will happen! ,I have faith that I will get pregnant soon. Why is it so hard? Isn't that what a women's body is built to do?,5526
5527,trusting,It's hard to trust anything  even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray. ,Yeah  more people are having these issues these days. I think it may be true that someone may be poisoning us through the water and food or something! It is a scary world!,5527
5528,caring,Thats kind of you  did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? ,I found a lost baby duck. The mother was no where to be found. I brought it home and took care of it until it was big enough to be let loose again.,5528
5529,caring,Sounds like it went well! ,The duck flew away and was never to be found again. Hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family. I just hope so.,5529
5530,angry,Yes  I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.,I feel so upset when other people tell such horrible lies about other people. Some people are just cruel and are only out for themselves.,5530
5531,angry,I just ignore them. At some point  they stop but they understand that it is not working.,Yeah  it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.,5531
5532,caring,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. ,This past week my 3 year old son caught strep throat. I ended up having to miss the entire week at work to stay home with him.,5532
5533,caring,It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.,He is  i hated missing work  but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children.,5533
5534,embarrassed,Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right  my god. Bring extras next time? lol ,My high heel broke in the cement the other morning and I had to wear them all day at work. Not a good day!,5534
5535,embarrassed,I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. ,Yeah  from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying!,5535
5536,furious,That's very sad  has he considered getting help for his addiction?,My father continuously gambles all his earnings away even though he has two minors to support.,5536
5537,furious,I can certainly understand your feelings  I hope he can somehow fix his habits.,Nope  he doesn't care and denies it's an issue. When I found out  I was too angry to look at him.,5537
5538,nostalgic,Has it been a lot of fun?,My friends and I started playing Halo online recently.,5538
5539,nostalgic,Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood  such a great game.,Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.,5539
5540,content,I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things  especially if you've partied before already.,I feel happy to just stay in and watch a movie at home on a Saturday night. I have no desire to go out and party like most people I know do.,5540
5541,content,That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.,Yeah  been there done that. I don't miss those hangovers on Sunday morning. Totally not worth it anymore.,5541
5542,content,Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?,Last month finally  after years of working towards it  I was finally promoted into senior management at my job.,5542
5543,content,Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?,Yes it did  and much better benefits. Seems like I finally got to the end of a very long road.,5543
5544,hopeful,I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!,After working for years at a job I didn't like  and struggling in school  I found a new job that coincides with my Major.,5544
5545,hopeful,That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!,Thanks! For the first time in a long time  the future isn't looking so dark.,5545
5546,embarrassed,Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.,Last week at work  I went to sit down at my desk chair and completely missed it and fell straight into the floor.,5546
5547,embarrassed,Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.,Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.,5547
5548,jealous,Yea  I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.,I know I should not feel like this but I feel so envious when I drive through the rich neighborhoods and I know that I will never be able to live there.,5548
5549,jealous,Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.,I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well  I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket  lol.,5549
5550,anticipating,Oooh  how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?,Last month my wife and I ordered our first new car with a delivery time of six weeks. ,5550
5551,anticipating,I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!,We ordered a new Ford Superduty pickup. This six weeks is taking forever.,5551
5552,disgusted,Indoors?,In the 6th grade  a bird pooped on my back during lunchtime.,5552
5553,disgusted,In the 6th grade? Where is this school?,Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors. ,5553
5554,disgusted,Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.,In Quebec. All schools have a budget for extra-curricular activities and events. We had a barbecue once every year in June with free food.,5554
5555,disgusted,How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.,That sounds awful  all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.,5555
5556,jealous,Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either,Last month  a buddy of mine bought a scratch off ticket and won $4500. I never win anything when I buy them.,5556
5557,jealous,haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play,I mean I am happy for him and all  but I wouldn't mind some found money either.,5557
5558,devastated,Oh god  I am so sorry. Is he okay now?,Our puppy wiggled out of his leash. He ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car. It was awful,5558
5559,devastated,I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.,Sadly  no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later.,5559
5560,afraid,Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.,coincidence  I too I'm taking a trip but a business one  I 'm not looking forward to flying,5560
5561,afraid,Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.,a couple of time  but it truly scares me,5561
5562,anxious,You have to be more careful next time  maybe you need a calendar to remind you.,The other day I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication.,5562
5563,anxious,I am so sorry to hear  I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.,I put an alarm on my phone  I just get so busy some mornings. At least it didn't affect me too bad until the next morning.,5563
5564,confident,That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.,I am feeling pretty good after my interview for a promotion at work last week. My boss told me I nailed the interview.,5564
5565,confident,Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.,Well I have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates  so I have a really good feeling about it.,5565
5566,terrified,That must have been a bit scary  You should have called the police.,The other night  drunk bicyclists were following me home and laughing on the sidewalk.,5566
5567,terrified,You cannot be too careful these days  i am so sorry that happened to you.,I wasn't too far from my home so I figured I could tough it out. I was pretty scared however  especially since it was nighttime. ,5567
5568,joyful,Okay! Now that is interested  I would love to see them.,NASA released some free space posters a couple of months back.,5568
5569,joyful,Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.,I think they have them up on their website  you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall!,5569
5570,joyful,Free? That makes it even better  I will be getting me some posters.,"Yup. The poster files are free  you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa  Trappist-1e  Mars Explorers Wanted and ""We Need You""",5570
5571,joyful,I hope so too. Thank you so much!,Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!,5571
5572,afraid,I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?,Yesterday I found a massive spider in my room.,5572
5573,afraid,I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.,It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it  even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.,5573
5574,grateful,Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?,There was a chance that it could rain on the day my best friends and I went camping.,5574
5575,grateful,That sounds like it was a lot of fun!,It barely did at night  but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't  because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.,5575
5576,lonely,Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/,looks like we have something in common  when i walk through my house  the rooms are empty. There are no one here but me,5576
5577,lonely,Yeah i would get a pet,i know  i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable,5577
5578,lonely,That is so sweet of you. I love cats  you must be a caring spouse.,I was watching over my girlfriend's cat while she went away on a little trip.,5578
5579,lonely,The cat didn't like you  oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.,I like to think so  thanks! Unfortunately  the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.,5579
5580,sad,I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it, Ever since I started taking medication for anxiety and depression  I've been gaining weight. ,5580
5581,sad,Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle,I have  she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life  and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.,5581
5582,annoyed,Its a good guard dog then, No matter who comes to the door  my dog barks.,5582
5583,annoyed,What kind of dog is he,In a way yes  but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house  he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.,5583
5584,devastated,Animal accidents can be really bad!,I was driving down the highway when I saw a car in an accident. It seems they hit a cow! Oh my!,5584
5585,devastated,At least no one else was injured  but it is sad about the cow. ,I felt so bad for the poor cow. It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.,5585
5586,sad,Just cherish the moments,my pet dog is getting older. I know one day she won't be around anymore,5586
5587,sad,It will be okay,I will  but just the thought of it makes me blue,5587
5588,proud,What kind of job is it,I put in a lot of effort and energy and I found a new job!,5588
5589,proud,That is a nice job I am sure,It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself. ,5589
5590,ashamed,Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?,I came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor's package that was sitting out.,5590
5591,ashamed,That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.,No  but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.,5591
5592,excited,Awesome  congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift  is there a particular game you're eager to play?,With all the money I've been saving up  I should be able to purchase an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality system soon!,5592
5593,excited,Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!,Hmm maybe Robo Recall  a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!,5593
5594,apprehensive,Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?,I went on a new bike trail the other day  it was super fun but also a little scary.,5594
5595,apprehensive,I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?,Yep  exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike  I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.,5595
5596,apprehensive,I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!,Absolutely! And now that I know it better  I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday  can't wait!,5596
5597,surprised,What kind of con was it,I made a new friend at a convention I was volunteering at. I was shocked.,5597
5598,surprised,that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that,Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime  Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).,5598
5599,trusting,That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?,I participated in a ropes course with my colleagues  we had to learn how to trust each other.,5599
5600,trusting,Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.,Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall  but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.,5600
5601,trusting,Why did you do tht?,I let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself.,5601
5602,trusting,That makes sense  you are a good older sibling!,She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.,5602
5603,ashamed,I would imagine  that is a lot to drink!, I once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick.,5603
5604,ashamed,I get that  well I hope you feel betternow!,It really is. I felt so bad about my actions  but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.,5604
5605,apprehensive,why is that?,I never learned how to ride a bike.,5605
5606,apprehensive,I get that  did your friends know how to ride bikes?,My parents never saw the importance I guess. ,5606
5607,apprehensive,Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot,They did  but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.,5607
5608,sentimental,Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?,My girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday.,5608
5609,sentimental,Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol,I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.,5609
5610,devastated,Oh  I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... ,My cat has terminal kidney failure. There's no cure.,5610
5611,devastated,Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.,It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.,5611
5612,devastated,Oh no   what happened?,I received horrific news from a best friend recently.,5612
5613,devastated,That is terrible  you must have been devastated   I hope he find the help he/she needs.,They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.,5613
5614,annoyed,Oh dear  but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.,you know at work  one of my coworker is always singing to himself  it bugs me,5614
5615,annoyed,He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.,it really is  he thinks he knows how to sing  i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing ,5615
5616,embarrassed,Haha no way  I thought that only happens in cartoons!,One time I slipped on a banana peel,5616
5617,embarrassed,I'm sorry but I probably would have  too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!,Yep  everyone was laughing at me,5617
5618,caring,That is unfortunate  is he doing any chemotherapy ?,My neighbor was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad form of cancer.,5618
5619,caring,Well I hope everything works out for him!,I'm not entirely sure of the regimen  I didn't want to ask too many questions. But I've been bringing pre-cooked meals over for her and her husband when I get a chance to help them out a little.,5619
5620,anticipating,What were you waiting for!,One time I was waiting all day for the mail man to deliver my package,5620
5621,anticipating,Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!,I was waiting for my computer monitor!,5621
5622,sentimental,How well did it work out for you?,I ran out of laundry soap the other day  when I went to the store I grabbed a brand I hadn't used in many years.,5622
5623,sentimental,Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!,Oh it worked fine  but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?,5623
5624,jealous,o no what did you do?,One time I saw my husband looking at another women,5624
5625,jealous,o no im not sure that was the best response,I slapped him and beat up the other women,5625
5626,embarrassed,Oh No! Did you get hurt?,I was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door.,5626
5627,embarrassed,I bet that was a little embarrassing. ,Well  physically not so much  just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!,5627
5628,ashamed,Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it,I was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade. In retrospect this is slightly embarrassing. ,5628
5629,ashamed,That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!,Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!,5629
5630,caring,That is great to hear that things are going well for you.,Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome!,5630
5631,caring,I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.,Thanks that means a lot to me!,5631
5632,anticipating,How long has it been since the interview?,I was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer  I really wanted the job.,5632
5633,anticipating,Oh well congrats and good job!,That's the thing  my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company  it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!,5633
5634,jealous,Oh that is awesome for your friend!,My friend just won $500 in scratch-off lottery tickets!,5634
5635,jealous,Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.,Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious  I hate to admit.,5635
5636,confident,That was probably not a good idea  how did it go for you?,I took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level.,5636
5637,confident,Well  you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.,It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills  so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.,5637
5638,prepared,That can be kind of scary. How did it go?,When I was interviewing for a promotion at my job. I did all I could to get ready for the interview. ,5638
5639,prepared,Awesome  congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.,It went great. I having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready  I knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me. ,5639
5640,furious,Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up,At my job a coworker took credit for a job I had completed. Once I found out  I went straight to my boss and got it straightened out.,5640
5641,furious,For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it  most people dont',I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.,5641
5642,prepared,Aww haha how many bags did you bring,We went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff.,5642
5643,prepared,Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one,It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff  I packed it well. But the joke's on him  he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.,5643
5644,furious,That sounds awful!,This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!,5644
5645,furious,Have you tried talking to them about it?,Yeah  it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on  every single night? It's really ticking me off.,5645
5646,nostalgic,I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy  I didn't know that they still exist either!,An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist.,5646
5647,nostalgic,I loved that too!,Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!,5647
5648,content,That is wonderful to hear  good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.,I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about  luckily!,5648
5649,content,Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.,Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!,5649
5650,nostalgic,Aw  that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. ,I was cleaning out the attic last week  and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things. I sat for hours just looking at old photos.,5650
5651,nostalgic,Did you share it with anyone else?,It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.,5651
5652,hopeful,Nice  a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?,I recently applied for a job with a  new company. It would be such a step up for my family if I got it.,5652
5653,hopeful,Well I hope you get it. Good luck!,Some  I did well in the interview. Just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision.,5653
5654,hopeful,That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?,I'm waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity  it would pretty much be my dream job.,5654
5655,hopeful,I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.,Not sure  hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.,5655
5656,embarrassed,I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery,Most of the decisions that I made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect.,5656
5657,embarrassed,Ha YOLOOO,I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun  at least.,5657
5658,anticipating,I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season  too?,I can't wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold. I love Autumn!,5658
5659,anticipating,I don't mind winter either but you're so right  the temperature is just right during fall.,Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.,5659
5660,disappointed,Awe  sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.,I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed.,5660
5661,disappointed,That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!,Well  not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.,5661
5662,prepared,I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?,The house is all cleaned and ready for my guests. Wow  I was cleaning all day!,5662
5663,prepared,I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh  how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah  you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.,Yes  there is no better satisfaction  in my opinion  than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.,5663
5664,disgusted,That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?,My neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes.,5664
5665,disgusted,I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.,No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.,5665
5666,confident,I certainly hope so   Why do you want to move?,I have fixed up house to the best of my ability. I feel very certain that it will sell very quickly.,5666
5667,confident,That sounds great  That is how I like my houses to be too.,I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :),5667
5668,hopeful,Hmm  don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?,I feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness.,5668
5669,hopeful,Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet  I hope it works for you!,I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..,5669
5670,anxious,Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?,I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it.,5670
5671,anxious,Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!,Yep  it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!,5671
5672,furious,Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun ,I get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood. It is so infuriating!,5672
5673,furious,Yup gotta lay down the law,Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great! ,5673
5674,terrified,Terrifying! What was it?,I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night.,5674
5675,terrified,Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?,It turned out to be the sump pump  I guess it was old. But yes  it scared the daylights out of me!,5675
5676,guilty,Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?,I made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people I work with and it got back to him.,5676
5677,guilty,That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.,No  but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it  but I still felt bad for it  mostly that I did it behind his back.,5677
5678,content,that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?,I got my work done early on Friday so I got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!,5678
5679,content,Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!,I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.,5679
5680,sentimental,How come you can't take them anymore?,I miss being able to take my children to the park.,5680
5681,sentimental,Awww  well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!,they are all grown up. ,5681
5682,confident,That's intense. I hope you did well!,"I studied all night for my final exam""",5682
5683,confident,Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved,I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !,5683
5684,angry,I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!,the neighbor's dog barked all night and kept me up  let's say I am not very happy right now,5684
5685,angry,Right  I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them,i understand the dog is being a dog  but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it,5685
5686,impressed,Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.,My cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats.,5686
5687,impressed,That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.,Right? I wasn't even mad about it  I was astounded by his ingenuity.,5687
5688,faithful,That is great! Hopefully he continues to be,I feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world,5688
5689,faithful,Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even,I think he will. He puts up with me  and sometimes i can be a pill!,5689
5690,devastated,Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?,I was so upset when I had to put my dog down last month,5690
5691,devastated,I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.,Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.,5691
5692,devastated,That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?,During my first year in grad school  my basement apartment flooded. EVERYTHING was destroyed and I had to start over fresh.,5692
5693,devastated,Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. ,Thankfully  yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things  so many things I just simply couldn't replace. ,5693
5694,ashamed,Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!,I am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job. Last week  I made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should've paid $100.,5694
5695,ashamed,To be fair  everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!,Thankfully  not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!,5695
5696,content,Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?,My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight.,5696
5697,content,Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.,I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun  we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.,5697
5698,embarrassed,What was her reaction to that,I drank a lot and told my girlfriend that I would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so.,5698
5699,embarrassed,I am sure she will forgive you,She was a little sad and surprised  but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless  I felt very ashamed the next day.,5699
5700,content,That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time,My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep  of course.,5700
5701,content,Have you ever passed out together watching tv?,It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together  just us. ,5701
5702,content,How old is your baby?,Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!,5702
5703,content,And how long have you been married?,8 months old - but by looking at him  you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!,5703
5704,disappointed,that is exciting! will it be your first house?,My wife and I found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it.,5704
5705,disappointed,that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one,Well it would have been  but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.,5705
5706,trusting,You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?,I let my friend watch my dog last weekend.,5706
5707,trusting,Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?,It was good  he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!,5707
5708,embarrassed,Oh no  what did you do?,I once almost ruined my husband's master's thesis presentation--something he needed to pass to get his degree.,5708
5709,embarrassed,Don't worry  from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.,I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!,5709
5710,anticipating,Lol that makes a lot of sense?,I was expecting a surprise birthday party today.,5710
5711,anticipating,well that sounds fun!,Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party  but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!,5711
5712,disgusted,Haha caught red handed!,Last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant  I got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen. I saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone's plate.,5712
5713,disgusted,Yeah  I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service,We proceeded to leave the restaurant  but not after informing the manager  very loudly  about the incident. ,5713
5714,apprehensive,Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.,I hope I do well when I start school soon  I can't help but think it will be too hard.,5714
5715,apprehensive,Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!,Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.,5715
5716,anticipating,Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?,My husband's been searching for a professional job but can't seem to land one after interviewing.,5716

5718,anxious,Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young,Last month my son had to have surgery to have his tonsils removed.,5718
5719,anxious,I understand  when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still,Yeah  I was terrified. I just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine. Seemed like it took days.,5719

5722,jealous,Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting  or wish she were more responsible with her money?,My little sister has been going all across the country this summer  spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert.,5722
5723,jealous,Yeah  I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities  it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively  I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.,Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!,5723
5724,terrified,Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!,During this past spring during a bad storm  we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard.,5724
5725,terrified,Yeah  thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.,It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt.,5725
5726,faithful,Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? ,I don't like joining it when people talk about someone that's not there  just like what happened yesterday.,5726
5727,faithful,Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. ,He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.,5727
5728,confident,Sounds like your co workers respect you then,I work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers--it makes me feel like an expert  though I'm not.,5728
5729,confident,Or that as well ha,They seem to. Or  at least  they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!,5729
5730,guilty,Did you ever get caught?,When I was a young kid  I stole some comic books from the local grocery store.,5730
5731,guilty,Was she disappointed?,My mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager. That was a humbling experience.,5731
