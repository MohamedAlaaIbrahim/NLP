6,excited,Which Concert?,I couldn't wait to go to the concert.,6
7,excited,Wow  that's awesome! I have never been to an actual concert.,The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go  but somehow we did!!!,7
8,sad,Ugh  those articles always get me too... :( What was wrong with her? ,I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors,8
9,sad,Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really. ,she was born premature at home  she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying,9
10,caring,That is nice of you. What did you do?,so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up,10
11,caring,Which one?,i was singing nursery songs :),11
12,hopeful,He will  I have faith.,my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon,12
13,hopeful,No problem. What kind of work does he do?,thank you so much!,13
14,angry,Thats not good. Do you own a gun?,i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods! ,14
15,angry,That is always number one goal.,I do! I want to be able to protect my son,15
16,joyful,3 years is a long time. How come?,i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years,16
17,joyful,Oh I see. They must miss you  too.,I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry,17
18,angry,That isn't very nice.,I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident,18
19,angry,Yes. I do not have a Facebook.,Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.,19
20,disappointed,Thats horrible.,So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised  and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer,20
21,disappointed,Yes I do not like walmart.,Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed  such a terrible feeling!,21
22,faithful,Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?,My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married  and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!,22
23,faithful,Thats a tough situation.,I struggled with it  but my friend was in a really bad spot  with no income and raising her grandchild  he was the financial supporter. So  I didn't tell her  as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways  plus she really loves him!,23
24,content,I guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted  lol. But it doesn't last forever and is worth it. ,my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house,24
25,content,That's a full time job raising a human,i totally agree with you!,25
26,lonely,Oh  I'm sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?,hi  i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country,26
27,lonely,That's a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself  but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!,i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms,27
28,annoyed,oh man. i'm all about discipline! I don't like spoiled bratty kids,I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home  he grabbed a game and sat on it  instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me  especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.,28
29,annoyed,yes  i've heard some parents don't ever say no to their kids. makes no sense,Me either! I have two of my own children  and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!,29
30,terrified,ok,I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died,30
31,nostalgic,Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!,I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well  and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.,31
32,nostalgic,I understand that  I hope things work out well for you both in the end!,Yes  they ended somewhat well  but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well  but I miss her.,32
33,content,That is a very blessed day. It is something you will never forget.,One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.,33
34,content,Yes  I couldn't agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change.,Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for  and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.,34
35,grateful,I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.,Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!,35
36,grateful,Oh I'm sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.,Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.,36
37,grateful,Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?,Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend,37
38,grateful,Oh wow  that's awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got and to not take it for granted.,My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be ,38
39,trusting,I agree  someimes we just know,I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me  but it always seems to be spot on.,39
40,trusting,exactly  i get that entirely!,"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right  it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led  even if you might not fully know to where.",40
41,surprised,That's great! How did they surprise you?,I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best! ,41
42,surprised,That is so sweet of them  I hope you enjoyed it!,I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there,42
43,lonely,Awww  That sucks man. Hopefully they don't say mean things to you about being lonely.,I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely,43
44,lonely,Well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone. I think you will too.,Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes,44
45,surprised,Yeah that is always odd to me  before they can talk they are already unique!,As silly as it sounds  I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.,45
46,surprised,That is how it goes  sometimes you can just figure them out immediately,One was pacifier  one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep  one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier  one liked cocooning in a sling!,46
47,disappointed,I understand that one they are my favorite place to eat,The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.,47
48,disappointed,That has happened to me too many times to count,Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.,48
49,grateful,That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.,I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family,49
50,grateful,Uau  what a surreal moment.I always believe kids have a lot to teach us.,Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him ,50
51,hopeful,I'm sure it will! I didn't get along with my dad until i became an adult.,My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older  it will get better!,51
52,hopeful,Yes it did. I believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together. ,That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh  my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?,52
53,ashamed,Where you not secure in your self?,I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others  but that doesn't make me feel any better.,53
54,ashamed,You can track her down to say sorry  or would that be creepy?,Well  like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately  she was. As an adult of course  my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!,54
55,ashamed,Wow  so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe you'll see her in the next life?,"Unfortunately  she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out  and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.",55
56,impressed,Lucky you! That is rare. Maybe one day people will think of you like that?,I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.,56
57,impressed,I have something totally different. My boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader. ,That's a very kind statement  and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm  not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?,57
58,impressed,Well I've been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people. So I pull from what I learned from them.,That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself  and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?,58
59,surprised,It's crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?,My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!,59
60,surprised,That is how life goes! Different schedules and demands -- I'm sure she's so thrilled when she *does* get to see you!,It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often  even though we live 30 minutes away.,60
61,proud,Wow  that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like you're on top of the world after that!,Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!,61
62,proud,"My first thought was ""California"" but then there's Venice [Italy] and then either way  that's an amazing destination!",Ah  it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!,62
63,proud,Oh  wow.  Not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!,We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-),63
64,surprised,I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out? ,I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.,64
65,surprised,That's a real bummer  but as they say  there are plenty of fish in the sea!,She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.,65
66,angry,I feel the same way.,I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.,66
67,angry,I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.,How do you channel the anger? Obviously  it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!,67
68,sad,Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?,One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.,68
69,sad,Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!,She was around 11  so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school  as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.,69
70,excited,ooo they are gonna love it  just its expensive  I remember when it was only $20 to get in.,I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!,70
71,excited,Which one are you going to California or Florida ?,Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson  and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!,71
72,nostalgic,Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?,I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.,72
73,nostalgic,Yeah  I miss my dad.  He died several years ago.  What kind of car is he looking for?,We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.,73
74,surprised,I'm trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips? ,Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!,74
75,surprised,My big thing is i'm like O' I may need that leave it out of the tote box. Before I know it I have more stuff laying around then when I started.,Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.  ,75
76,annoyed,Well  sometimes people are busy and don't have the time to check emails,I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.,76
77,annoyed,Text and emails are still the best option.  until a nw way is created.,It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation  how do you ensure communication?,77
78,angry,Isn't that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?,I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.,78
79,angry,Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again  you can try to approach the topic from another angle.,I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.,79
80,lonely,Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?,I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas  my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!,80
81,lonely,That must have been quite the culture shock  glad it all worked out though!,From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!,81
82,sad,I know  that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot.,One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.,82
83,sad,Yea for sure  I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. When's the last time you have been really disappointed? ,That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person  though  that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.,83
84,ashamed,I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?,Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.,84
85,ashamed,I guess he wanted to be available if she needed him.,Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess,85
86,furious,What is a back neighbor? And that is crazy!,There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time  simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!,86
87,furious,Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!,Yes  she lived several house back and she didn't know me  until after she did that! She knew me then  but after I talked to her  she apologized to both of us. ,87
88,grateful,I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?,Too often  it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.,88
89,grateful,Yes  we should try to yourself heathy,Happily  I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves  you know?,89
90,sentimental,Oh  it sure is  I feel the same way. They grow up so fast! ,Every time I look through older photos of my children  I'm taken right back to the time they were that size  and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling  for sure.,90
91,sentimental,One of them is! I have an 18 year old and a 12 year old.,Are your kids adults now?,91
92,confident,I bet you were beautiful on that day. :) I hope that confidence has carried on since then!,I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!,92
93,confident,It would be hard to replicate that day for sure  but I bet you have a lot to be confident about. You got this!,I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.,93
94,anxious,I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better. ,"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times  since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.",94
95,anxious,Your so lucky. Insurance is my number one worry every month. ,We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed  right there.,95
96,jealous,Oh ya? What happened?? I'm intrigued,I met up with an old flame recently  didn't go how I expected,96
97,jealous,Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you? ,Well  right after she gave me a big hug  she introduced me to her new boyfriend.,97
98,excited,OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?,My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!,98
99,excited,PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit  go to HUNTS in PCB - it's off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!!,We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida  about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!,99
100,annoyed,Why didn't you go?,I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.,100
101,annoyed,Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?,Well  we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it  she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!,101
102,afraid,Did he do anything to you and your mom?,Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!,102
103,afraid,I am glad that nothing happened.,Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!,103
104,guilty,No  you didn't tell me! What happened?,Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.,104
105,guilty,Oh no! Is she okay?! Don't beat yourself up too much  you couldn't have ever imagined that she had been in an accident.,She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out  she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!,105
106,grateful,What happened?,Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party! ,106
107,grateful,I love Fireball.,Well  I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish  so I had... well too many.,107
108,disappointed,No  what happened?,Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?,108
109,disappointed,Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?,Well first of all  it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT! ,109
110,surprised,Who  tell me!,You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...,110
111,surprised,Wow  what happened?,My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!,111
112,surprised,That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Father's day?,Recently  my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts  it was very unexpected!,112
113,surprised,That is great.,I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!,113
114,confident,Oh what job was the interview for?,I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch  but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!,114
115,confident,I think you got it man! Congratz!,This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?,115
116,terrified,oh my  are you really serious?,"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?",116
117,terrified,I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary,As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots  and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building  and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us  and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!,117
118,angry,Oh no  what did you do?,I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me  as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!,118
119,angry,Did you ever tell your friend?  ,I quietly pushed him away  as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset  since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.,119
120,disgusted,Oh no  I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer,This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it  and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!,120
121,disgusted,I wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad. ,Yes  and of course we tried to call and have someone come out  but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!,121
122,guilty,Wao  you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?,I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me  but I never told her about it. ,122
123,guilty,SUper tough situation  i think you should let her know  and let her decides next,I felt bad  but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild  and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out  not to mention she really loves him.,123
124,embarrassed,Oh  I'm sure you were embarrassed! But  maybe you can laugh about it now?,I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her  can you imagine my reaction to it?,124
125,embarrassed,Well  I'm sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!,Yes  totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth  didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching,125
126,anticipating,Ah  that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?,I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach  with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!,126
127,anticipating,Sounds awesome! Do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? (Mine would be tequila + lime...very Jimmy Buffett ;-)),Well  we are staying at Panama City Beach  so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.,127
128,proud,Well  that's impressive! I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!,I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer  and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!,128
129,proud,Yes  I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!,That  and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-)),129
130,annoyed,Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.,Okay  a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!,130
131,annoyed,Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol,Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals  if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-),131
132,joyful,oh wow. Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?,I came home  and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby  my heart speeded so fast!,132
133,joyful,First time parent?,We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.,133
134,confident,What kind of work do you do?,"I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.",134
135,confident,Actually I'm not  but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations  I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day.,I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture  and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!),135
136,impressed,I agree  its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas,"I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from  that challenge them  and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".",136
137,impressed,Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business,"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity  if not failure!",137
138,joyful,Baby belugas are cute  but not as cute as your baby!,I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago  and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-),138
139,joyful,That is so funny! I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.,"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out  and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot""  the spunky little girl ant in the movie.",139
140,surprised,That is great!!  Sometimes we mom's get a bit forgotten  so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling.,This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt,140
141,surprised,Those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing  I love it when my girls do that!,Yes  definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards ,141
142,confident,I am not sure  it was pretty random,THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?,142
143,confident,No  nothing at all,Did they give you any feedback?,143
144,confident,I know,That is a shame  you need to learn from your mistakes.,144
145,surprised,That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!,So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.,145
146,surprised,Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.,I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July,146
147,disappointed,I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?,Oh no  what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?,147
148,disappointed,I haven't heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?,"Yes  I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.",148
149,disappointed,Sounds interesting!,It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.,149
150,confident,Did it go your way?,I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer  and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.,150
151,confident,That is great - have you found another job yet?,Yes  I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.,151
152,annoyed,I hate traffic too  it makes me angry,Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!,152
153,annoyed,People are so rude when they drive these days,Yes! People were constantly cutting me off not signalling and slamming on their brakes,153
154,afraid,I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.,The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.,154
155,afraid,That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me  I was too curious to not see the others.,And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.,155
156,proud,She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.,My best friend did amazing in school  despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.,156
157,proud,That's great. I wish I had someone so close like that!,She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.,157
158,sad,Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?,Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.,158
159,sad,Oh  I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated.,I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.,159
160,excited,Put what word ? You mean published the info?,I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy  so I put the word out,160
161,excited,So what breed did you get ?,Basically  yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!,161
162,grateful,I would be too! You did what you had to do!,When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan  which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them,162
163,grateful,Do you find the home buying experience worth it?,Yes  I am always better off with them as my parents  they want to see us succeed,163
164,grateful,How long do you plan on staying in that house?,Yes  it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.,164
165,grateful,Well that's awesome! I'm happy for you!,Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married,165
166,jealous,You shouldn't  because that is  a very stressful job,My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200 000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.,166
167,jealous,And don't forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery,Yeah  that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance  and is on call a lot.,167
168,hopeful,Really? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? I know sometimes it's tough to settle on a path.,I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future,168
169,hopeful,That sounds like a great career plan. You will be filling a very important role in the physician's practice!,I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path,169
170,disgusted,I'm not sure. What would you do?,That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?,170
171,disgusted,Maybe I will try that. Do you think it will work?,You could chat to them and complain!,171
172,grateful,Oh no  that sounds like an awful situation. What did you end up doing after that?,One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at  my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.,172
173,grateful,So exciting! It can be fun to have a roommate,I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.,173
174,grateful,I love that. Lots of new friends  haha,She also has 2 daughters  2 and 7  and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.,174
175,nostalgic,I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?,Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood,175
176,nostalgic,Where I grew up didn't have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.,I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era,176
177,nostalgic,Good lord you must have had Facebook for a LONG time! I started mine in college so there isn't anything from my younger years.,The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.,177
178,nostalgic,Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!,Oh no  it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends  food  toys  tv shows  etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.,178
179,nostalgic,I am 33 :),How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.,179
180,furious,Me too  bullies are part of the reason that I homeschooled.,I hate bullies. Playground or politics  I find them intolerable.,180
181,furious,Well  I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19.,Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?,181
182,surprised,I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.,I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.,182
183,surprised,Yeah it was so boring. Even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it ,Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.,183
184,angry,That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it??,My parents keep taking my money,184
185,angry,Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts  so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5  $10) save it and be strict not to spend it.,They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.,185
186,annoyed,"LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the "" You are an adult not a child"" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed  then you have to deal with the consequences. ","So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!",186
187,annoyed,Okay  it wasn't just one  it was three: One cherry  and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh  the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like  I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids  I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would  but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now  lol,LOL! Okay  y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes  I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?),187
188,devastated,Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. That would be incredibly hard. What happened?,The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.,188
189,devastated,That's horrible. I'm really sorry about your friend. ,She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up  she slipped.,189
190,devastated,That's a beautiful name! It's cool you honored your friend in that way. ,It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it  but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.,190
191,devastated,I can't even imagine. I've never lost anyone super close to me yet...,It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.,191
192,grateful,Did you not have a car? That's hard. I don't have one now and use Uber and Lyft all the time.,A few years ago  there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time. ,192
193,grateful,That is incredible! I swear some things in life are determined by fate. I'm glad you were able to get a car.,We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!,193
194,grateful,It's incredible  and so important. That's why I try to pass on the kindness whenever I am able.,Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind. ,194
195,surprised,Yes.My first was when i turned 18.,Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.,195
196,surprised,LOL.You had to beg your husband for a surprise party??,That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year. ,196
197,terrified,Did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?,It was raining hard one night and the power shut off,197
198,terrified,Well atleast you have something to help you guys.,Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles ,198
199,prepared,How did you do,One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.,199
200,prepared,That is great! My B.S. ( I always hate saying that because I have to say I have my BS in psychology) is in Psychology.,I ended up actually getting a 98%!,200
201,annoyed,Pet? Like dogs and other?,Do you have any pets?,201
202,annoyed,Wow  seriously I hate those pets being around me,Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff. ,202
203,proud,From where?,My son graduated. ,203
204,proud,Congrats  that's a step forward,Highschool.,204
205,lonely,I am so sorry. I can't imagine what you must have went through.,One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.,205
206,lonely,That must have been really hard. ,I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.,206
207,impressed,Really?  What kind of work does he do?,I know this guy who is so young  yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.,207
208,impressed,Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.,He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.,208
209,sentimental,Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?,I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really  really not.,209
210,sentimental,Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?,"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..",210
211,sentimental,Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.,No  they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.,211
212,nostalgic,All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.,Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?,212
213,nostalgic,I know what you mean.  However  the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.,Yeah  I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..,213
214,sad,Oh no!  What happened to it?,I was just thinking about how a few years ago  we lost our cat.,214
215,sad,So sad!  I am sorry.  Don't feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside.,It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(,215
216,caring,it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying ,I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.,216
217,caring,Oh yes but it is not as bad and you cannot call it dying like in Cancer patient ,The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha,217
218,disgusted,Did you get sick afterwards ,Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends  so gross.,218
219,disgusted,i do not think sushi is that good too. The best option is to stop eating them in any form of food,Extremely  but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish  unless sushi because they properly prepare it,219
220,surprised,Damn that sounds like a pretty good one! How did that turn out?,I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!,220
221,surprised,That's how all pranks should be!,I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!,221
222,lonely,I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???,My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.,222
223,lonely,Oh that's too bad. ): I don't want to overstep but I always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up. ,I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.,223
224,lonely,I think that's good! If you are meant to be together you'll feel it and it will work out I think  if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it! ,I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.,224
225,lonely,Aw  that's sweet! I really am hoping y'all make it through this together. (:,We have dogs and chameleons together  so it's like we're already a little family haha,225
226,disappointed,So sad you can never force someone to love you. You will find the right person for you.,I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.,226
227,disappointed,Don't give up on love.It the best feeling ever to experience. Wish you well.,I hope so. Maybe one day  but I am not so sure.,227
228,hopeful,Do you have a good chance with her. Have you talked to her about it?,I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.,228
229,hopeful,That will be better. Talk to her before you lose her,I think she has expressed interest in me in the past  but she recently moved  but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.,229
230,surprised,Probably one where I got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant  it was great. What about yours  what makes your friends so great too?,I am very lucky  my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?,230
231,surprised,I wish my friends bought me alcohol  that would make for a hell of a night! ,Wow  I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!,231
232,annoyed,hi are you there?,5,232
233,annoyed,That must be hard I always wished I had a sister though I have a brother ,I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.,233
234,afraid,Oh my! You must have been terrified! Did everything turn out ok?,I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.,234
235,afraid,That is not good at all. That is a very scary situation.,Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt  though.,235
236,content,I have not tried yet  but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight,Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?,236
237,content,I live in a place where it only snows once in 10 years. So  i think i am passing on that,Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha,237
238,grateful,You are so lucky. Mums are the best. What do you do for her?,I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me  even to this day.,238
239,grateful,You should spend time with her whilst you can. My mum died and I wish I had been with her more.,I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.,239
240,disappointed,Nothing went wrong  we just have different lives in different places. I go visit every now and then.,You know  that is tough  but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?,240
241,disappointed,I did not revise. Sometimes exams are failed and things are not corrected.,But you failed the exam? Did you revise?,241
242,trusting,That is great that you have an awesome Mom!,My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.,242
243,trusting,Yes I do love my mom very much.,She's amazing. Do you love your mom?,243
244,sad,ooh  am so sorry about that. Have you tried to talk to her?,I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.,244
245,sad,that will help you know her stand on your relationship,It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month  so I will likely discuss it when she returns.,245
246,lonely,well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs.,That sounds tough. What do you do/,246
247,lonely,it pays decent and feeds the kids so I can't complain.,That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.,247
248,hopeful,That's awesome. What are you majoring in?,I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.,248
249,hopeful,Sometimes it's good to have something you enjoy make money so you can pursue your passion without worrying about it.,Environmental engineering! I enjoy it  but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.,249
250,afraid,That is such a bummer. Why did you keep watching them?,I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear. ,250
251,afraid,I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though. ,I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.,251
252,afraid,I like scary movies as well so I know how addicting they can be.,I've been telling myself that for years  I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?,252
253,afraid,"It is actually ""Scream."" ",What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?,253
254,disgusted,"Oh yeah  Donald Trump is such a charlatan. He has some really shady history too. I'm actually a Christian and a conservative but I'm appalled that everyone on the ""right"" have fallen for this guy. He's so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be.",Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.,254
255,disgusted,Yeah  I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general. Ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government. ,I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him  too.,255
256,excited,awwww. congratulations. what is your major,I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida,256
257,excited,lovely. thats really great. wishing you all the best,Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.,257
258,faithful,That is interesting  how does he buy you stuff or is he just really nice?,I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.,258
259,faithful,I am happy for you wish I could find a nice lover like that.,He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.,259
260,sentimental,Yes  I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?,Do you like to go through old family pictures?,260
261,sentimental,That's great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.,Absolutely. I love to hear my mámá tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.,261
262,jealous,:( I'm very sorry. Have you tried telling her how you feel? That could affect her decision.,I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.,262
263,jealous,I know it's hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that  but you don't want to keep them to yourself. If you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try,I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.,263
264,sentimental,I'm not quite following. Anything you want to tell me about?,How long?,264
265,sentimental,Well did you have any story or anything that you had in mind that you wanted to tell me? I told you a story of mine before so you owe me haha.,About what exactly?,265
266,trusting,That is really nice of her.  It is nice to have someone to help you do things sometimes.,My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.,266
267,trusting,Yes.  Too many people these days are mean to one another!,Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!,267
268,devastated,That's so sad  I hope you've gotten over it.,My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.,268
269,devastated,That's good  death is a natural part of life.,It is tough  but I think I will make it.,269
270,jealous,No u don't have to be ,My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!,270
271,jealous,Yes u will surely get over it,It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.,271
272,caring,That is very special and I am so happy for you.,I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.,272
273,caring,Yes  married for 15 years and it is still great.,I am very happy  too. Do you have someone special in your life?,273
274,grateful,That's good to have a loving family.,My family is very loving. They care about me so much.,274
275,grateful,I am i love them very much. However we live on opposite parts of the country.,I agree. I hope you are also close to your family!,275
276,guilty,Wow  7 years? You were really young then,I stole my friend's Pokemon card when we were 7. I still feel guilty about it.,276
277,guilty,But did you tell your friend about it later?,Yes,277
278,embarrassed,Oh no! That must have been super embarrassing! How did you react to that?,I one time lost my trunks in the pool! People saw me in a way I didn't want!,278
279,embarrassed,My goodness  well I guess that happens to all of us at least once.,I covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!,279
280,proud,That sounds fun  starting a new life is always great!,I recently graduated from college. I loved it and now I feel great about my life!,280
281,proud,West Coast is fun  but it can be expensive.,I agree. I am thinking about moving to the West Coast of the USA.,281
282,surprised,Because she was what?,we went for a doctor visit because she was ,282
283,surprised,I think that is a good news for you both since you are not married,"sorry lol. because she was ""late"". but she told me the result was negative  not pregnant. so then we went to a furniture store just to browse",283
284,lonely,I can imagine the loneliness someone can experience.,Having the whole house to your self sometimes isn't as good as it may seem!,284
285,lonely,Get your self a friend to stay with for a couple of months.,My whole family is out the house for a few months. I'm going to be so bored with no one around...,285
286,excited,Wow  please make it real.,I have a huge chance to win a PS4!,286
287,excited,Wow  I belief u can make it.,There's only 2 other people in the final round! Winning a PS4 will be awesome!,287
288,disappointed,Who is supplying these snacks? ,My son really needs to cut down on the amount of sugary snacks he has!,288
289,disappointed,Sounds like a cupboad cleaning is necessary. If they ain't around  they can't be eaten.,Well  my wife gets them on deals  so likes to hoard them in the cupboard. ,289
290,lonely,why did she go visiting?,the house is very quiet now that she's been gone for four days visiting with her family,290

316,angry,Just give it a trial,Sometimes I think the management don't even care!,316
317,guilty,Haha  how did she feel when she found out?,I ate so much of my wife's cookies  but she shouldn't make them so irresistible. ,317
318,guilty,Oh no! Those cookies sure do sound delicious though.,She made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale. The cookies were for charity  you see.,318

321,prepared,How do you make it?,The key to making good chicken and rice  is following the recipe precisely ,321
322,prepared,Good to know.  I will do it like it next time.,You've got to cut up all the ingredients  and put it in small containers  before finally cooking all at once.,322

327,faithful,That's cool.  For what class,Without prayer  I don't know if I would have passed that important test!,327
328,faithful,God works in mysterious ways,It was a test in Numeracy  so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult  but god made it possible!,328
329,impressed,wow. I would be too. I love guitar  it's my favorite musical instrument. I wonder if he was born blind,Hey! I saw a blind man play a guitar once. Was so surreal and I was so impressed,329

344,terrified,lol. don't do the crime if can't face the Bat ;),I know! This one was absolutely huge  almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it  it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!,344
345,grateful,Praise God man! He really is amazing and we should always be grateful for we have ,Every day I thank God for my blessings. I'd be in hole right now if it weren't for HIM,345
346,grateful,amen! so true. Its especially awesome when He picks us up in every fall. His love never fails,especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it,346
347,ashamed,for real? that must've been embarrassing. Sorry to hear about that,Once during an important school sporting event  my entire sports team was counting on me but mid-way through my event  my shorts fell down and I tripped ,347
348,ashamed,well that's good and bad. hopefully the joke didn't carry on too long,yea! it was! I thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when I went back to school  everyone just made it a joke so its alright. This was about 5-6 years ago now haha,348
349,nostalgic,I love me some Tupac. Real talk.,I love youtube. been listening to all my classic tracks. Tupac forever,349
350,nostalgic,Me too. I always end up on the 90s hip hop station on Pandora.,I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol,350
351,sad,Sorry to hear that. Did someone do anything against the company selling the food?,When I was younger  my dog died. He was getting up there in age  but he was still on the young side. Later  we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities.,351
352,sad,Someone should have sued them.,No  they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food  so it got contaminated. ,352
353,content,Oh yes  at least  you will be in a position to help them in return,Seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings I have been given,353
354,content,That is good. You have a good heart,absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :) ,354
355,anxious,You must feel awful   Why don't you come clean  maybe you will feel better.,hiding for almost 2 years but I'm still not over my paranoia that one day I will have to pay for what I did. Don't ask what it was,355
356,anxious,Yes Jesus can save you if you ask him.  He always forgive.,no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me,356
357,angry,He deserved that  I think.,When I was a kid  I went to this group with other kids my age  it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages  and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So  when he had his back turned  I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.,357
358,angry,Wow  interesting.,Yeah  I was pretty amazed in the moment  he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe  before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So  I ran towards where the parents were seated  stopped when I turned the corner  and walked calmly over to my mom  taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner  and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop  I looked like a helpless victim.,358
359,furious,Wow  you must have felt jealous,after she got her 1st job and new car  she started doing girls night out. Out until 3am one morning. I checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy >:(,359
360,furious,Hahahaa  its not easy though  I would have done same,jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol,360
361,impressed,When you have responsibilities that you really care about  you do what you have to. I commend him. ITs hard raising a family ,My dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn't like in order to support us  doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker. He even had a second job at Wal-mart for a while. I have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing.,361
362,impressed,Oh wow. Ive never heard of that many sick days.,Yeah  especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working  had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.,362
363,impressed,cool.,I think he got 3 weeks a year  only used like 5 days.,363
364,devastated,So  what was she lying to you about?,my instincts are never wrong. I found out her lies when I checked her facebook chat history. ,364
365,devastated,Oh  she shouldn't have done that,she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad,365
366,ashamed,Oh no how horrible,I never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like I did something wrong. I didn't force her,366
367,ashamed,oh no,ye and so I had to leave the country because of her,367
368,embarrassed,I hate public schools ooo,Public school really sucks sometimes. Making boys shower all together. I didn't want to but had to or else fail PE,368
369,embarrassed,But it's really cool atimes,yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten,369
370,grateful,Thats cool  I did online school in high school,My mom homeschooled me when I was little. I was in public school till first grade  but after that I was homeschooled. Did take a semester in grade 11 though to make sure I was up to current standards.,370
371,grateful,Well were pretty close in age,Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.,371
372,sad,I remember him  he was going to be a great actor.,I still haven't got over it. Brandon Lee RIP. I was 17 when I found out he died during filming. I visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago,372
373,sad,Yeah he might do a pretty good job as that character.,Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking,373
374,prepared,Adapting to life is always good to do.,I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better,374
375,prepared,Thats a great attitude to have. You should keep with that.,I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord),375
376,disgusted,How awful! how do you feel about it?,I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.,376
377,disgusted,Yes I understand  it is really sad when you find that people you have known a long time can be very different from what you thought.,Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.,377
378,furious,Lols why didn't you do anything ,I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.,378
379,furious,Awww but it's still good that you didn't push him  Cox it might lead to something else ,I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him. ,379
380,proud,Oh My Goodness! How wonderful!!!! That is so awesome! Congratulations. ,I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself.,380
381,proud,Wow! I better! I Stopped at Associates of General Studies  because I wanted to be a mom more. So that is a HUGE step for you! ,Thanks! It was a huge challenge  and I'm SO glad to have it behind me! ,381
382,proud,This is TRUE! I am glad to be at home with these guys right now. Have a great day! ,Being a mom is great  too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks! ,382
383,content,Congratulations! I hope to get a house next year,I feel happy about the new house I have and that I can work from home. Thanks be to God,383
384,content,I bet! Hard work pays off,It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.,384
385,caring,Things happen that are bad  I am sure it wasnt your fault.,I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards.,385
386,caring,I am sure they forgave you in the end.,I was distracted by the sound of running water.,386
387,nostalgic,Music always seems to be better from the past  I understand all too well.,I can't get enough of music today. Especially all my songs/bands from when I was in my twenties.,387
388,nostalgic,I totally agree  new music is not as good.,Its true though  they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.,388
389,anticipating,I get paid today as well! What game are you thinking about getting?,I get paid today and I'm getting this new game I've been waiting on to be released!,389
390,anticipating,Didn't that game come out a few months ago? I got it shortly after I released and I wasn't very impressed. It wasn't a bad game  but it certainly was not the best game.,I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.,390
391,grateful,Congratulations. That sounds like the fast track.,Hi  I joined a firm 6 months ago and then I got a promotion for Junior Manager,391
392,grateful,Cool. Maybe next year you will be a partner!,yes  They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position,392
393,grateful,I hope you get it,Maybe yes  Haha  Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager,393
394,annoyed,I am so sorry to hear that! Is there a particular section you are having trouble with?,Hi  I have applied for a driving license thrice and I have failed in all the thee,394
395,annoyed,Ah! That's quite understandable. It is tricky at first and non-intuitive. I practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot. ,Yes  I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.,395
396,annoyed,I know it's hard  but practice makes perfect! Keep trying and I am sure you will get it!,every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.,396
397,joyful,Why what is the matter?,I still can't believe my life is where it's at  especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.,397
398,joyful,Hmmm! That is just annoying being an alcoholic. I purely understand your situation as I have gone through it. Well! life goes on.,Well  for many years I was an alcoholic  working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!,398
399,joyful,that is great..congrats....,It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests  and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!,399
400,embarrassed,Thats creepy honestly,Yesterday  I was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open. ,400
401,embarrassed,Yeah whispering in someones ear is weird,It was just very creepy situation,401
402,hopeful,Nice! What job is going for,My hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job,402
403,hopeful,Cool.  Hope he gets it  I hear they pay pretty well,armed security,403
404,afraid,Just you. No security?,I stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared.,404
405,afraid,I would be too. ,no  I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.,405
406,joyful,That's nice  how long did it take you ?,I have been awarded with a degree in marketing.,406
407,joyful,Fantastic  now do you have a job lined up?,it took 4 years but at last got it,407
408,surprised,I've been in a fender bender not a total wreck.,Hey  have you ever been in a car wreck?,408
409,surprised,Man  how was your insurance policy for that?,I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt  but it totaled both of our cars.,409
410,furious,Yes  Several times in my life. Mostly me and my older brother when we were younger.,Have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?,410
411,furious,What started the fist fight in the first place?,I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.,411
412,nostalgic,I haven't heard of it,Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?,412
413,nostalgic,Everything old makes a come back!,It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.,413
414,disappointed,One of my favorite places to eat. I love the swirled ice cream cones.,Have you ever eaten at Hardee's?,414
415,disappointed,Over priced food is no fun. I like dollar menus.,I like it too  but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny  and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!,415
416,terrified,Yep! Not really that fun to have since you see things at times.,Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?,416
417,terrified,Man that is scary! Granted i like to hear things about that. ,Yeah  in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.,417
418,confident,Yes when I was young I did all the time  but I think after I turned 18 I got this weird fear of being so high up in the air. What about you?,Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?,418
419,confident,Wow thats really cool! You must be happy to know about that stuff its interesting!,I hate riding them  but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.,419
420,faithful,What a creep. I hope that you told on him.,A while back my friend's boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him. He knew I had been married a very long time  as well as he was in a relationship with my friend. I turned him down flat  as I love my husband very much.,420
421,faithful,Some people are like that. Did you tell your husband?,Yes  I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!,421
422,prepared,Where are you headed ?,I'm going overseas and I think I packed everything i need! ,422
423,prepared,Great  I hope you have a nice trip. How long will you be staying?,Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much,423
424,proud,That's great! It was meant to happen then,Hi  My girlfriend was recently let go of her job  but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!,424
425,proud,I would have been too. I've never been fired. I always quit,Yes I agree  she was so happy when she found out the job was hers,425
426,proud,I remember taking Home Ec. I loved that class,She wasn't really fired  her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad,426
427,surprised,Oh wow  puppies are nice.  What kind of puppy did you get?,So about a year ago now  my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!,427
428,surprised,Thats a nice breed of dog.  I just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one  they are very loyal and smart of course.  Was he/she your first pet?,Yes  so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd! ,428
429,faithful,that's good! you should be proud of yourself,There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me  but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.,429
430,faithful,that's great! i hate when people cheat,I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!,430
431,annoyed,I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone  wondering if she'd show up. At least  it sounds like  she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?,There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.,431
432,annoyed,That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour  and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out  but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.,Yes  she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!,432
433,joyful,Ahhh! Me too  there is so much that can be done on the weekends!,I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!,433
434,joyful,I understand that! I have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!,i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever,434
435,afraid,Actually that has happened to me  during Thanksgiving,I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.,435
436,afraid,Im from NC mountains  it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast,Yes  when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous  and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.,436
437,afraid,That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice  but to keep going  bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is.,It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.,437
438,sad,I understand your pain. My parents are also separated.,When my parents got divorced when I was a kid  it was one of the hardest things for me.,438
439,sad,It just makes you mature faster. Just look at it like blessing in disguise.,It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.,439
440,hopeful,That sucks.   Did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?,Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach  but right before we left it started to pour rain.,440
441,hopeful,That's good to hear.  How was the beach?,Well  when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!,441
442,surprised,That would take away from her time with you. Was it for you?,There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.,442
443,surprised,That would be a really nice surprise then!,Yes  the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.,443
444,guilty,why'd you steal it ,There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend  and I feel pretty guilty about it.,444
445,guilty,oh yea what kind of shirt was it ,Because I really liked it  and didn't think he'd care.,445
446,lonely,What did you do to pass the time?,My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week  I was very lonely during this experience.,446
447,lonely,I love video games.,I mainly just played video games and watched tv.,447
448,sad,That sucks  why didn't you find a new apartment?,I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed  so I had to give her up. :(,448
449,sad,Maybe you should leave Florida.,Because here in my area in Florida  there isn't too many options for me.,449
450,grateful,Oh thats nice  what was she able to get for you?,My mom doesn't have a ton of money  but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!,450
451,grateful,thats awesome of her to be able to get you something you really wanted,She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!,451
452,trusting,Omg  I have seen one of those!,I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying  I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!,452
453,trusting,I believe that!,It was seriously so scary  I almost pooped myself!,453
454,jealous,What did you do?,There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom  I saw her talking to some guy!,454
455,jealous,Did she get mad at you?,Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!,455
456,surprised,haha that sucks! did you take him/her out to pee recently?,My dog randomly got up on my couch last week  and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!,456
457,surprised,What did you have for lunch?,Not since lunch  so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!,457
458,proud,That is amazing  good work.,I finally graduated college last year  it felt like it took SO long!,458
459,proud,How long did it take you?,Yes  I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!,459
460,ashamed,Oh wow. Did she break up with you?,My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl  who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..,460
461,ashamed,Don't sweat it man. There is plenty of fish in the sea anyways.,No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.,461
462,impressed,Nice  I wish I could do a wheelie!,There was this one time I was driving down the road  and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!,462
463,impressed,Yeah  I tried skateboarding in my childhood but was too scared to break something  lol.,I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!,463
464,devastated,Oh no  I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you ever figure out what happened?,When i was younger  I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.,464
465,devastated,Oh  well that's a somewhat happy ending I suppose.,He was very old  so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!,465
466,disgusted,Haha I'm sorry! My dog is chill now but he ate a hole in the wall when he was a puppy lol,My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!,466
467,disgusted,Yeah lol what breed is yours? Mine is a golden so he loves eating stuff. Now it's thankfully just actual food.,Oh dang  I guess I can't complain too much then  that's brutal!,467
468,guilty,Yea  I am like that  too. Did you apologize?,I have to go to confession at the church... i was a little mean to my mom  sometimes its difficult to be always nice,468
469,guilty,It happens. Like you said  we can't all be perfect.,Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad,469
470,joyful,Who did you do all those things with? Sounds like a wonderful day!,We walked  we ate ice cream  we rode a bike  we laughed a lot  we enjoyed the outdoors  we were exhausted,470
471,joyful,They must have been really happy.,I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul,471
472,impressed,There are so many spectacular views on this planet,The world is very beautiful,472
473,impressed,It's a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.,Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice,473
474,disappointed,That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people,I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.,474
475,disappointed,No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.,Well  it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself  is it?,475
476,terrified,Oh  wow! My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie  and we don't really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?,As a kid  I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.,476
477,terrified,Aw  poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or  are you still afraid of them?,That's the thing -- NO! I mean  there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!,477
478,terrified,Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow  what a cool thing to say!  ,"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future  right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason  it worked a charm ;-)",478
479,guilty,We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?,I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated  really.,479
480,guilty,I'm glad you're not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.,Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*  it's really about the person and where they're at.,480
481,anticipating,That is pretty awesome  I know if I ever got the chance it would change my life as well.,I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!,481
482,anticipating,I understand that  as long as I could understand the language I think I would be great anywhere.,I highly  highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.,482
483,surprised,tell me more about this,i would fear my gift ,483
484,surprised,if its an older iphone i would treasure it ,my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me,484
485,surprised,everyone values things differently,yes but its a valuable gift to me ,485
486,grateful,What does he do for work?,I have such an amazing husband! He works so hard so i could stay home with our baby,486
487,grateful,Oh wow  that is a dangerous job.,he is an armed guard,487
488,terrified,have you had it tested ?,I have a pretty bad vision so i'm so scared to drive at night,488
489,terrified,so you have like tunnel vision where ?,yes  i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on,489
490,annoyed,Yeah  that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you don't need it to.,It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!,490
491,annoyed,Yeah  everyone just seems miserable  so it kind of drags you down  too. But it's a necessary evil.,Yes! They cut in front  and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it ,491
492,guilty,that is why I am scared to have kids  that sounds terrible,I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible,492
493,guilty,that seems to be the case  you win some you lose some I guess,i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible,493
494,anticipating,Who would that be?,I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.,494
495,anticipating,I love seeing mine too. I know how happy that must make you feel. Mine are local.,O I'm sorry  my niece and nephews  only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?,495
496,joyful,thats good to hear.  my kids will returning to school soon as well.  I cant wait!,My kids are going into 7th and 8th grade in a couple weeks. They really are growing up well,496
497,joyful,thats cool,My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast,497
498,content,Every little accomplishment counts! What bills did you have to pay?,i paid all my bills today  i feel so relived and good,498
499,content,Sorry to hear that. Well  at least this will be a weight off your shoulders.,rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills,499
500,prepared,wow  you're so determined! Did you pass your exam?,I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!,500
501,prepared,yay! congrats! that's really awesome. you should be proud of yourself,I did pass! It was a rough 3 months  but once I got there  I felt like I was ready.,501
502,surprised,That's really exciting! I would be so happy about that. ,I was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn't need to pay for my baby'sticket,502
503,surprised,That's what I would do too. Do you have something in mind? ,i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool ,503
504,angry,Forget him. Get yourself a real man.,my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why ,504
505,angry,If he really loved you  he would pay attention to your every need. Kick him to the curb.,no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes,505
506,apprehensive,Be positive. Don't deviate your mind while driving. Concentrate completely on driving. You can.,When I was younger  I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive  because i didn't want to get into an accident.,506
507,apprehensive,Sorry to hear this. Hope you'll get out from this fear and become a good driver. ,I tried to tell myself that  but my dad got into a really bad accident once  and it has scared me ever since.,507
508,surprised,Sounds cool.,I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches. ,508
509,surprised,Do you cook a lot with tomatoes,Yea  i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots  wasn't expecting much.,509
510,surprised,Good for you!,I do yes! and since the method i used is working  i have tons of tomatoes!,510
511,angry,People just don't seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry.,Around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately. Driving around town is just crazy.,511
512,angry,That's the part that bothers me the most. When they just cut in front of you with no warning.,Yes  exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!,512
513,trusting,I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.,A few years ago  I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other  so we met up in person!,513
514,trusting,Well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself. Really great bunch of people and i see places.,I'd say it's going pretty well  we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?,514
515,caring,well you sound like a good person,OKay. I care for everyone,515
516,caring,why thank you!,Thanks  I hope I am. You sound like one too,516
517,surprised,Oh wow. That's crazy.,I recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past. It caught both of us off guard,517
518,surprised,I'm glad you made amends then and no drama.,Yes  it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations,518
519,proud,That's pretty amazing. She must be skillful regardless.,My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!,519
520,proud,Yea  experience and skills matter a lot more.,She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.,520
521,annoyed,I am familiar with that.  That is frustrating.,I walked my dog outside  and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.,521
522,annoyed,I ask myself the same thing.  Sometimes I think they get mad at something we do.,Yeah...Even though I take her outside  10 minutes later  she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?,522
523,faithful,That is good. Do you have strong feeling for each other?,I think being with my husband makes me a better person,523
524,faithful,That is cute,Definetly  he's my best friend forever.,524
525,afraid,Things? Like what kind of things?,I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.,525
526,afraid,I know what you mean! I'm literally doing the same thing right now  babysitting my neighbor's dogs in her big two-story house  all alone. Makes me feel like someone's watching me...,Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah  crazy I know.,526
527,content,Thats really good to hear.  Whats going on?,I really love my life right now.,527
528,content,I work from home too.  Its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks.  Im so productive around the house,Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.,528
529,content,and I can stay in my PJs all day long!,Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.,529
530,surprised,Yeah  of course I can! That sounds heartless. Maybe that shows you who your friends truly are  and you should maybe look elsewhere... Could be a wake-up call.,So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?,530
531,surprised,Oh  I misunderstood! I thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wake-up call is you have really good friends! So  you like surprise parties then? I never did.,Well the party was for me  hahaha they really got me on that one!,531
532,guilty,What kinds of things are you talking about?,Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.,532
533,guilty,That's not very fair  a kind reminder could've gone a long way.,Owed money to my mother in law for something  $15  she reminded me in a less then nice way.,533
534,joyful,I have been there many times.,I went to San Antonio the other day  was great to see that city.,534
535,joyful,I love going to the Spurs games.,O really? What's your favorite thing there?,535
536,proud,Wow that is a long time ago.,I just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after 5 years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past 20 years! ,536
537,proud,Yes  where did you go to college?,Yes! i studied so hard  can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!,537
538,disgusted,That is so disgusting.  I hate seeing that!,I hate the sight of someone throwing up. My nephew did that the other and day and man.,538
539,disgusted,Sugar will do that to kids every time.  Just don't let them on a  roller coaster to make it even worse.,Yea  he had eaten to much sugar and well  it didn't end well,539
540,angry,That sounds really painful!  You should pick them up.,I came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos  i was so pissed!,540
541,angry,They must not listen very well.,Yes  i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.,541
542,jealous,Qdoba is the BOMB! Although  I think I prefer Chipotle slightly more.,My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today  one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile,542
543,jealous,Yeah  but Chipotle has queso now! But  yeah  it isn't as good as Qdoba queso. ,No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.,543
544,impressed,Wow! How is that even possible?,Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3  i was in shook!,544
545,impressed,I wonder if they ever feel like they don't get a childhood?,Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder  i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11,545
546,proud,Sounds like you are lucky.,My husband is quite impressive to me.,546
547,proud,That is great!,Yea  he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.,547
548,proud,I figure your son is pretty happy as well.,This afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!,548
549,proud,couldn't ask for a better day,Yes! i love him so dad  but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play  he dedicated the three goals to me!,549
550,embarrassed,That is no fun  you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time,I was doing a presentation for work  and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice.  No one laughed or even really cracked a smile  so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.,550
551,embarrassed,Well there is always next time!,Yeah  and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking  but at least should have gotten a chuckle.,551
552,lonely,you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!,My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.,552
553,lonely,Definitely. I think even Waze app will tell you in you search 'around me'. ,That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me  I should look into that.,553
554,surprised,Wow  that is sweet of him  does he have a crush on you?,Something I did not expect from a neighbor  this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers,554
555,surprised,Huh  well maybe he is starting his campaign lol,It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know,555
556,annoyed,What type of dog is it?,My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.,556
557,annoyed,I get that  some are just not well trained at all,A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically  but this one is just terrible.,557
558,jealous,Oh? That's not good. Do you think he has lots of secrets?,This morning my husband received a call  he got nervous  I think it was a woman ... difficult,558
559,jealous,I'm sorry :( I do hope things can be worked out,I think so ... I'm a little worried  because of the situation,559
560,sentimental,I assume you don't get to see them often?,I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot  makes me want to go hang out with them again.,560
561,sentimental,That's too bad. I bet you miss them.,Yeah  we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.,561
562,sad,Sorry to hear about the bad news.,Yesterday  a difficult day  the anniversary of the death of my mother,562
563,sad,How long ago did she die?,Thank you for your solidarity,563
564,hopeful,I hope you got it.,I went for an interview for a job I really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before I heard anything.  I managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while.,564
565,hopeful,Congrats! You deserve it for keeping your faith!,I did actually!  It's a good job  especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.,565
566,sentimental,How old is she?,My daughter is angry with me  she says she does not need me  because I scolded her,566
567,sentimental,Well  you know she'll get over it  but it does hurt.,She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl,567
568,prepared,oh  how nice. What are your plans in that regard for the future?,Hello  tomorrow I have the cooking test and I feel safe. I am sure that I will approve with an excellent rating,568
569,prepared,What a dream come true for you that'll be.,have my own restaurant,569
570,proud,Oh man  bills. That's awesome!,I'm so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!,570
571,proud,Does anyone help you with the bills?,yes  such a relieve!,571
572,grateful,awh thats so sweet how long have you two known one another? ,Sometimes we have angels  called friends  I'm happy because God sent me mine,572
573,grateful,sounds like a great friendship! ,We are 12 years old  but we have had difficult moments  but we have overcome it,573
574,disgusted,Oh no. How old is he?,my son behaved badly with his friend  I treat him badly  I had to punish him,574
575,disgusted,Friendship is special. Did he do something to his friend?,He is 12 years old  but he must understand that friendship is something sacred,575
576,jealous,Man  that's gotta be a horrible feeling. I think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others.,When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying ,576
577,jealous,I hope things turn out better for you. Keep fighting.,I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with. ,577
578,confident,Oh man  that's awesome. I hope you get it!,I went to a job interview a few days ago  and I feel like I totally rocked it!,578
579,confident,Glad you rocked that interview. Sounds like it's gonna be a sweet gig.,Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job  so I really hope I do  but I think I got it in the bag.,579
580,sentimental,Awww I bet that brought back memories.,I went through some of my old stuff yesterday  and I found my security blanket that I used when I was a kid!,580
581,sentimental,What will you do with it now?,It really did. It kinda made me sad  because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.,581
582,disgusted,How so?,You know  I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.,582
583,disgusted,That's pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning  too. That's too bad.,Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor. ,583
584,caring,Did you name it?,I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road  and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.,584
585,caring,That's cute. I bet he's happy.,I did! His name is Alphy.,585
586,sad,You kinda want to hold their hand  but you know it's best they solve some problems on their own. You can't be with them all the time.,It's hard as a parent  when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems,586
587,sad,It is truely for the best. Try not to worry.,I know  they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to,587
588,proud,that's amazing! She must be excited.,My wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with Microsoft! ,588
589,proud,Must be nice to have more income coming into the family.,She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.,589
590,caring,Is he going to be okay?,I felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him. We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.,590
591,caring,Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.,Yeah  it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.,591
592,guilty,Lol. Did you tell her? You can just buy another one.,I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store  and I was going to give it to her  but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.,592
593,guilty,Just buy another one and don't eat it. lol,lol I didn't tell her...Should i?,593
594,angry,That's sucks. Does the culprit know?,Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.,594
595,angry,That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?,Yeah  that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.,595
596,excited,That sounds so fun! ,I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!,596
597,excited,Take some medication with you just in case.,I've never been  so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.,597
598,nostalgic,So...what happened to her,Hello  I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair  the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes,598
599,nostalgic,In real life? Or are you making this up,she died ... my mother,599
600,terrified,I've never imagined something like that before. Where did you see this?,Hello  I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed,600
601,terrified,That's nuts. Did the owner do anything?,in a big dog ... in the park,601
602,caring,I suffer a lot too when my wife is gone. What happened to him?,My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband,602
603,caring,Ah  the evil cancer. Took my grandmother as well. I am sure he's off in a better place now.,He passed away from cancer.,603
604,surprised,Nice! How old is your nephew?,I enjoyed my day the other day  found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.,604
605,surprised,That's good. Gotta build and maintain those family bonds. I should be doing the same once my nephew gets older.,11  he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.,605
606,ashamed,That sucks. Can you make it up to her somehow?,I lost something of my mother in laws the other day  I feel so bad.,606
607,ashamed,At least those things come in sets  so you can keep part of it?,I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear  it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!,607
608,anxious,It is a work award or something?,I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award,608
609,anxious,I am sure you are going to get it.,Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for,609
610,apprehensive,Why Thank you!,Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive  but it sounds like a good opportunity.,610
611,apprehensive,THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.,No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.,611
612,apprehensive,I know what you mean. Did you get the job?,I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!,612
613,apprehensive,I have not. What is it?,I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?,613
614,annoyed,There are some bad parents out there  that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?,I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.,614
615,annoyed,Lol  that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck...,It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.,615
616,angry,That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?,I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.,616
617,angry,Don't worry  it will get better. I know you deserve better,Well  for the most part it's my family. My husband  kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!,617
618,joyful,I know exactly what you mean. My sister is entering her teenage years. I feel like it's all I can do to just not be annoying to her  so I can't even imagine what it's like for a mom.,My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.,618
619,joyful,That's good! All it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older. My mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her.,Yeah  luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.,619
620,anticipating,Where are you going?,I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.,620
621,anticipating,I've never been to California.,I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.,621
622,disgusted,That must of been terrible.,I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend  and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.,622
623,disgusted,Did anyone help you?,It WAS. Since she was wet  the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.,623
624,content,You're making me want to do the same thing. That sounds great!,Been having a good day  relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.,624
625,content,Nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!,Yeah  it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.,625
626,apprehensive,Was it on the phone or in person?,I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.,626
627,apprehensive,How did you do?,It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room  then we took a lab tour afterwards.,627

636,furious,Oh no  what happened?,It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake,636
637,furious,Oh  that's odd! I'm sorry they didn't tell you what was going on. ,placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it  so they gave me something else without telling me,637
638,furious,No problem! I hope so too. Good luck with that!,Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen,638
639,lonely,really?,I really was distraught,639
640,lonely,ok,yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok,640
641,impressed,Who was your rep?,it made me proud he was my rep,641
642,impressed,Aha. What was the association?,the president represented us at this association,642
643,lonely,Did you got bored?,It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.,643
644,lonely,I understand.,I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.,644
645,hopeful,That is a very long drive! How long will it take to get there?,I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.,645
646,hopeful,It must be very good  if you're willing to go that far!,About an hour. But it'll be worth it.,646
647,content,Wow  you're very lucky. Do you share the facilities with other people?,I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.,647
648,content,Which part of the country are you in? Are you by the beach?,Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.,648
649,surprised,Was it fun?,I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.,649
650,surprised,Was it recently? Happy Birthday,It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up  go to work  etc. but I was wrong about that!,650
651,joyful,Oh goodness  what happened for the past 3 weeks?,It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now,651
652,joyful,Oh  I was thinking something bad happened.,She went to visit her family,652
653,devastated,Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain. ,It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother,653
654,devastated,Take care of yourself and your family.,Thank you for your solidarity,654
655,surprised,I am sure it will be fine  do you have a preference,We knew she was pregnant  but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!,655
656,surprised,I am happy for you then,Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met,656
657,faithful,That is good  it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!,Even though there are plenty of flirts around  I remain loyal to my wife.,657
658,faithful,Good for you! I wish more people were like this  unlike my ex! ,It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one  which was 5 years ago now.,658
659,jealous,You should channel that envy into motivation!,My friend got a new truck  I'm really envious of him.,659
660,jealous,Exactly  be positive and you can buy one for yourself!,I agree  if I work hard I could buy that truck. ,660
661,joyful,That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.,Hello  I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it,661
662,joyful,I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!,If I really like to be positive  despite the difficulties,662

664,caring,haha that must be nice too though  you get your own alone time for the most part!,It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol,664
665,grateful,I see  you must have felt hopeful,This morning and I saw a tree  I never detailed it  but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists,665
666,grateful,Good  one should always be positive,I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties,666
667,surprised,thats adorable how old is she? ,Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful  I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed,667
668,surprised,she sounds like it ,she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl,668
669,guilty,That's a pretty heavy realization...better tell him now that regret it later,Hi  I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband  but I do not have the courage to tell him,669
670,guilty,Best of luck to you,You're right,670
671,confident,what are your options? ,I'm looking for a new job  and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.,671
672,confident,oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure ,There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately  especially technical support.,672
673,lonely,It is an excellent opportunity  to know other people and places  to open up to the possibility  I assure you that it will go to you very well,My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here  so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.,673
674,lonely,You do the same thing ... the opportunity is for both,I'm sure it is great for her  but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.,674
675,embarrassed,That sounds like it's rough  did your father accept your apology?,Hello  I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs  and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad,675
676,embarrassed,Well  I'm sure he understands  and you shouldn't feel too bad  as long as you apologized you're fine.,yes  but I feel like a cockroach,676
677,guilty,it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes. dark chocolate is actually good for you! ,I'm supposed to be on a diet  but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.,677
678,guilty,hey it was just one day! you got this... work extra hard for the next 5 days! ,But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(,678
679,grateful,That's awesome,my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!,679
680,grateful,I'm sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does,He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby,680
681,annoyed,I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window. ,I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.,681
682,annoyed,My bedroom is first floor  and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol ,Ugh  that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.,682
683,disappointed,Did you retrace your steps,I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big  did i just leave it somewhere?,683
684,disappointed,I used to lose stuff all the time.  Then I learned to relax and actively imagine all the places I'd been to.  It worked for me then  found a G-shock watch a pair of nikes and my wallet,I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it,684
685,excited,that's great! I bet they are equally excited if not more :) are you travelling alone?,I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited,685
686,excited,oh i bet! you guys will have such a wonderful time together,no  with my little baby. they've never met my son  they can't wait,686
687,joyful,I would be too  that is a long time!,My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.,687
688,joyful,Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe,Yeah  it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.,688
689,angry,Wow did youcall someone about that?,I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.,689
690,angry,Wow  that sucks  that is why I wanna live all alone!,No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.,690
691,embarrassed,Oh my  did they notice you farted?,my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing,691
692,embarrassed,Must have rather awkward. Remember  farting is just natural and I am sure she understands that.,she did  she didn't say anything but i know she heard it,692
693,lonely,I am sorry  how have you been passing the time,My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends  and left me alone to fend for myself.,693
694,lonely,I love video games  you should buy a switch!,Mostly been playing video games  but it's so boring without her.,694
695,grateful,that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way,Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not  the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth,695
696,grateful,how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?,For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it,696
697,grateful,this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .,for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible,697
698,grateful,i would totally attempt it ,condition the mind and spirit,698
699,devastated,I am so very sorry. Have you had time to talk about it,I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.,699
700,devastated,that's good prayer can comfort  maybe you should talk to your pastor,yes  I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort ,700
701,apprehensive,Ooh  that's a big jump. I was considering the same thing  but I' one state above :),I had plans to move from Florida to California  but I'm starting to get cold feet...,701
702,apprehensive,I put it on hold until I fly up there this year to check things out. It's quite a big decision  and I would recommend going there for a while just to see what it's like,Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.,702
703,hopeful,Yes  realistically I wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way ,today I think today is a day to learn  to hug  to smile  to make someone happy,703
704,hopeful,Maybe thats a good idea  to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!,that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that  to my children I kiss them  my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something,704
705,lonely,Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?,I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends  no husband  no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life,705
706,lonely,Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.,not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward,706
707,excited,You must be ver,My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!,707
708,excited,*very excited.  (oops).  Where did she go?,I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.,708
709,joyful,where are you going,I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation,709
710,joyful,that sounds like fun  where in the ozakrs?,A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water. ,710
711,angry,Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of A-holes,I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them  to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.,711
712,angry,Hm maybe she liked you ha,Yeah  it was weird  the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing  but she responded to me almost instantly every time.,712
713,guilty,Free pizza is good! How did you get it?,I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.,713
714,guilty,That is awesome!,The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl  who was brand new  didn't know so she just didn't charge me.,714
715,hopeful,It was fine how about you?,how was your day?,715
716,hopeful,I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling you as we just met.,yeah good. whats your name?,716
717,disappointed,My day was great so far!  How about you?,hello how was your day?,717
718,disappointed,That is good to hear!  I'm am sure you are grateful to experience such a good day!,yeah fine great day,718
719,embarrassed,Oh that sucks :( Maybe organize the socks better?,I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But  no was there to spot it. But  when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At  that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.,719
720,embarrassed,Ah. Well  chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!,My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.,720
721,hopeful,That's great! When will you find out?,I went for a job interview  and it seemed to go pretty well.,721
722,hopeful,Good luck! I hope you get it.,It should be a couple weeks  assuming they go at the pace they said they would.,722
723,lonely,I know how it feels to be homesick  but you have to put your wife first.,I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.,723
724,lonely,You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.,Yeah  definitely  that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people  so it can be tough.,724
725,sad,Ohh man  that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?,I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.,725
726,sad,I'm sorry.  Where did she go?,Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.,726
727,angry,What happened? Did someone bump on your car?,I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.,727
728,angry,Be carefull   you don't know the cray people that is out there.,No  the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.,728
729,embarrassed,That must have been awkward.,I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.,729
730,embarrassed,Don't worry about it. It happens to the best of us.,Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off  but I sure felt stupid about it.,730
731,sentimental,Nostalgia can be wonderful  can't it?,"I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment  and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.",731
732,sentimental,I feel the same when listening to 90s alternative music,It can  but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore  but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.,732
733,annoyed,What was going on!?,Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.,733
734,annoyed,sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight ,My friend and her mom were fighting about money  and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.,734
735,hopeful,that's really good you feel pretty secure about it then?,I had a job interview today and i think it really well.,735
736,hopeful,oh wow then that is really good! For someone to say that! You should be very proud of yourself.,The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.,736
737,embarrassed,Thar was an embarasing moment for sure,I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog  but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.,737
738,embarrassed,Maybe you are felling lonely these days?,Yeah  I don't like calling people out in general  don't know what made me think to do it this time.,738
739,furious,Did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?,I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.,739
740,furious,Weird reaction. I feel like he should just do his job and not key your car.,I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.,740
741,apprehensive,What are you worrying about?,My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.,741
742,apprehensive,Well  I hope it's alright  heart problems is not something you should take lightly.,I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.,742
743,nostalgic,What is your favorite memory with your friends?,I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child. ,743
744,nostalgic,That sounds like so much fun! I'm glad you got to go back to revisit.,Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes  icecream  catching fireflies.,744
745,grateful,You deserved for graduating.,My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.,745
746,grateful,Just keep working hard and make them proud.,Thanks  now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.,746
747,faithful,I'm glad to hear you have something you can lean on in hard times. I'm personally an Atheist but I can respect someone with faith.,The more problems I have to deal with  the more faith  and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.,747
748,faithful,I absolutely agree. As long as you aren't hurting anyone  do whatever you please!,"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt. ",748
749,ashamed,Oh man  I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad  though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?,I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well  but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.,749
750,ashamed,Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!,I'm just pretty embarrassed  I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.,750
751,jealous,I'm not jealous of my co-worker though?  What makes you think i'm jealous?,I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.,751
752,jealous,I didn't say that.,You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.,752
753,guilty,That would be sad  do you keep him in a cage?,I just got a puppy  but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.,753
754,guilty,That's nice  what does he enjoy watching?,Fortunately  no. I let him run around the house  but I feel like he gets bored  so I keep the TV on for him.,754
755,guilty,Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?,Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.,755
756,guilty,I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!,If that is the case  I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain  then it is most definitely wrong.,756
757,sad,That's so sad  I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?,My dog disappeared while I was away at college.,757
758,sad,My goodness  that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours.,My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.,758
759,anticipating,Do you have some big plans for the visit?,I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!,759
760,anticipating,Uh oh  have you ever delivered a baby before?,Probably not  because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away  so she will be here when she has her baby. ,760
761,anticipating,Oh right  I am a doctor.,Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors! ,761
762,anticipating,I am a baby delivering doctor!,Oh cool! What kind of doctor?,762
763,impressed,What was the accomplishment again?,Oh wow  you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.,763
764,impressed,Wow  that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?,My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort  and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.,764
765,grateful,What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?,I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home  and it made me reflect on my own life.,765
766,grateful,What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?,Lately  I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds  when I saw him  I thought life could be much worse.,766
767,grateful,Oh no! I hope it didn't fall on anything or anyone!,A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.,767
768,grateful,Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!,No  it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.,768
769,jealous,Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?,I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.,769
770,jealous,Please tell me who she is!!!!!,She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.,770
771,nostalgic,I know exactly how you feel  I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything.,Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend  time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!,771
772,nostalgic,Hahaha yes  you are so right. Then again  I'm a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real  more important and awesome life to look forward to one day.,Didn't the sun always shine back then  when we were happy and young and had money?!,772
773,afraid,Wow  that's terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?,Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time  but now I worry that they will come back.,773
774,afraid,What a story  it's just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals.,Yes  my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.,774
775,angry,That is is awful.Did you call the cops,I woke up this morning  and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.,775
776,angry,You should install security cameras outside your house.,I did  they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.,776
777,disappointed,That's rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?,I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well  but I guess not.,777
778,disappointed,I hope that you hear back from them soon. It ain't going to be rough forever - someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!,Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.,778
779,embarrassed,Oh no  that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!,Last week  my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.,779
780,embarrassed,I am so sorry that happened to you!,I ran out of the gym crying  and the whole class pointed and laughed. ,780
781,annoyed,Yuck  sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!,I love my cat  but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.,781
782,annoyed,Well  at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.,She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles. ,782
783,anticipating,Oh really?! Where you headed too?,I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!,783
784,anticipating,Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it? ,We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to  and we will be seeing the ocean as well!,784
785,ashamed,Did you have a severe diarreia or something?,I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.,785
786,ashamed,I am sure your friend will forgive you.,Yes  it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.,786
787,proud,Oh cool! How did you win it? ,I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy  proud,787
788,proud,Oh cool! I love chess! What did you win? ,It was for a chess competition. ,788
789,annoyed,Wow that's annoying  my husband is always telling me about his co-workers being the same way. ,I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself,789
790,annoyed,Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.,Yes  it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people  but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.,790
791,disappointed,Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.,I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.,791
792,disappointed,Well  a wise man said that having patience was a virtue  I think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.,Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be  so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting  I guess.,792
793,embarrassed,I think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say,I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around  and people laughed at me.,793
794,embarrassed,Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know,That is good advice. I feel better about this.,794
795,joyful,That's great  how wonderful! I hope y'all had a good time.,I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.,795
796,joyful,How great  I'm glad to hear that.,It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week  not 20 years ago.,796
797,surprised,How old was the child?,I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!,797
798,surprised,Wow  that's awfully young for that kind of thing.,She couldn't have been older than one!,798
799,disappointed,Oh that's not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere,I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly  it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do  even though I put my best work and most effort into it.,799
800,disappointed,Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated,It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.,800
801,anxious,Oh no! Are you going away this weekend?,I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone  I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.,801
802,anxious,Hopefully  she answers soon. Maybe she's taking a nap or is in the shower.,Yes  I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.,802
803,hopeful,I am in the same boat  but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have. ,I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday,803
804,hopeful,How funny! I know how you feel though. I have always been poor.,That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks,804
805,hopeful,Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy. ,ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair,805
806,disappointed,Why? How did that happen?,I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.,806
807,disappointed,That's so sad. I feel sorry for you. ,Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere. ,807
808,disappointed,Yeah. Do you have back up plans for this issue?,I feel sorry for me too!,808
809,faithful,That's nice  I'm glad you feel that way.,They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them,809
810,faithful,I do feel that way  I try to always have a Christian attitude.,Yes  what about you? Do you feel likewise?,810
811,joyful,That's nice of her! It's always good to have friends to fall on,I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up,811
812,joyful,Oh  that's even better. That's truly a friend you can rely on. You're very fortunate.,yes  and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money,812
813,impressed,Skateboarders have some serious skills! I can barely walk a straight line.,I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard  but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.,813
814,impressed,We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! ,I know  right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid  made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line  never managed to do anything else.,814
815,ashamed,Maybe you could try to better that?,I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!,815
816,ashamed,You could start a trend.,I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them,816
817,caring,He will make it,I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(,817
818,caring,It will help eventually,I know he will  i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky,818
819,angry,That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.,I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.,819
820,angry,I hope the owner knows better next time.,Yeah  I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one  but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.,820
821,annoyed,Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!,I just recently finished potty training my dog  that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.,821
822,annoyed,For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!,I can imagine a rescue  generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get  can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!,822
823,grateful,THat is stressful.  Are they ok?,My dog started looking really sick and in pain  but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet  so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.,823
824,grateful,That is really good to hear,Yeah  he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing  but he got medicine and rest and is good now.,824
825,content,I certainly do.  Lucky to be healthy and able,I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?,825
826,content,Good question.  I am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!,I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?,826
827,hopeful,I hope you get the job! What was the position you applied for?,I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.,827
828,hopeful,That sounds like it pays nice?,A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!,828
829,grateful,No. Why do you ask?,Have you ever had to file for disability?,829
830,grateful,I'm sorry to hear that. How far along in the process are you?,I've had to recently. Its been really tough.,830
831,annoyed,I actually do not have any kids right now,Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?,831
832,annoyed,I heard that was a really fun game though!,My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first  but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.,832
833,caring,Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.,I've had to help take care of others before as well.,833
834,caring,Oh no.I hope she gets better.,Yeah  I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.,834
835,hopeful,Well that's good  sometimes it's our failures that really show us what we're made of. ,I failed my driving test twice  but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.,835
836,hopeful,Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still can't drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.,I agree  I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.,836
837,disgusted,Did you say anything to someone?,I once went a restaurant  and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen! ,837
838,disgusted,a Burger King near me got shut down for that!,I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out  how can a place like that operate!?,838
839,proud,No  I do not have kids. Yours?,Do any of your kids play any sports?,839
840,proud,I bet you were really proud!,My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.,840
841,embarrassed,Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.,I was so late for work one day  I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!,841
842,embarrassed,Yeah  it sounds that way.,I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on  I was so in shock  even the neighbors saw. It was bad.,842
843,annoyed,That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers  they are so slow sometimes.,I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.,843
844,annoyed,Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy  especially during rush our!,The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.,844
845,excited,"Man  I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage  as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and ""new feelings"" going on as you watch it grow.",I was so excited when I got my new puppy  it was awesome!,845
846,excited,Yeah  but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy  so it's hard to keep up sometimes  but also fun!,I agree with you  the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions  positive ones of course!,846
847,nostalgic,What were simpler times?,Those were simpler times  I wish I could go back and relive those days!,847
848,nostalgic,Ah  I see. Had a great childhood  hu?,Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.,848
849,proud,Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?,I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child. ,849
850,proud,That's a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!,My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest  was the one that released the most gas.,850
851,anxious,I know what that's like. I have three kids.,I'm sleep training my toddler  he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad,851
852,anxious,They never slept in the crib lol. I won't even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close. I'm the wrong one to come to for advice lol,how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry,852
853,excited,That sounds heavenly,I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there  it was so much fun! We really had a blast!,853
854,excited,I envy you.  Have fun!,It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years  due to personal reasons  so you can imagine how we felt when we went!,854
855,sentimental,Time sure does fly and change is inevitable,As I look at my 21 year old son  I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!,855
856,sentimental,Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic,Yes  that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.,856
857,disappointed,what happened?,I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.,857
858,disappointed,time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck,Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.,858
859,anticipating,Awesome! What is he in college for?,My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!,859
860,anticipating,Holy goodness! That is really specialized. You should be very proud! :),He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.,860
861,grateful,That is very good to hear  hopefully things truly turn around for him.,We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!,861
862,grateful,Not yet  i just have one dog.,I hope so. Do you have any kids?,862
863,nostalgic,Oh that's neat! Did you find anything good?,I went to the flea market last weekend!,863
864,nostalgic,Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! ,Well  kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies  haha.,864
865,proud,Wow  that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed. ,I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.,865
866,proud,Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?,haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol,866
867,anxious,Wow  that sounds very disgusting.,My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!,867
868,anxious,I hope the baby rat is okay.,It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.,868
869,grateful,I'm so sorry but great to hear she is better now!,My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned  but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!,869
870,grateful,Well I'm glad to hear it's resolved.,Thanks  she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it  so it could have been much  much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!,870
871,trusting,Oh that's nice  I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?,I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.,871
872,trusting,Well how nice  that must have been fun.,The cat appeared very relaxed  but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.,872
873,terrified,Wow that must have been scary!,One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.,873
874,terrified,How long were you lost for?,If that wasn't frightening enough  I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!,874
875,ashamed,Wow back up there friend  what are you talking about?,I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway,875
876,ashamed,Context  what the heck are you talking about?,I wish it never happened now. ,876
877,ashamed,Seriously what the hell are you talking about??,she was 8,877
878,jealous,Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this  you never know what is going on behind the scenes  she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips.,A little while ago  my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years  due to issues beyond our control  so I begrudged her trip a bit.,878
879,jealous,I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead  you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.,Yes  true  I know they tend to let bills go for things like that  which I don't do. ,879
880,excited,You just had a baby?! I didn't even know you were expecting!,I am so happy it's a boy,880
881,excited,I'm so happy for you! Have you decided on a name yet?,He'll be here in about 3 months,881
882,prepared,Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?,Hey  I just started the keto diet!,882
883,prepared,Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast  but putting in effort goes a long way.,It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first  but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.,883
884,surprised,You must be over the moon happy.,Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy,884
885,surprised,Very funny. Have you decided on a name yet?,I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha,885
886,disappointed,Happy belated Birthday! Did it turn out the way you had hoped?,I just had my Sweet 16 party...,886
887,disappointed,What did you get instead?,Well  about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...,887
888,proud,Really? That is a good move,I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.,888
889,proud,You have As because you have high interest in studying  ,I was scared about it at first  but so far I have all A's. I must say  I'm proud of myself!,889
890,confident,Wow  that is truly incredible! What is your secret?,Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.,890
891,confident,That is so true! You are a true weight loss warrior I think!,As well as exercise and diet  by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.,891
892,content,Do you like it now?,I never liked milk growing up  because my family drank skim. ,892
893,content,I like 2% as well.  It's perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!,Well  first I tried whole milk  and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk  and I like it!,893
894,content,Have you tried 1%?,I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.,894
895,content,That's great.  2% is much more healthful than whole milk.,No  but I am satisfied with my choice. ,895
896,apprehensive,so very bad ya,I just got back from our vacation  but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic  and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge,896
897,apprehensive,ok,Yes  well  it was just one of those things I know  but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.,897
898,disappointed,Oh no! :(   How are you taking it?,Recently  I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.,898
899,disappointed,Dang.  Please don't blame yourself.,It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.,899
900,annoyed,Thats pretty long  how did you manage?,On my recent vacation to Florida  there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!,900
901,annoyed,Yea  something calming helps during fraustrating moments  but at least you know how the route is now,I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But  knew once we were past it  there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!,901
902,ashamed,Nice! Who's Robby? Is that your husband?,Robby got me flowers today.,902
903,ashamed,Aha! Was it actually your anniversary today? Happy Anniversary!,"Yes  how could you forget? It was a nice surprise  but then he said.. ""happy anniversary.""",903
904,embarrassed,Oh  wow... um  that's crazy. Why did you do that? ,dad caught me kissing my half aunt,904
905,embarrassed,I would imagine! I'd do the same thing if I was your dad  haha.,I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her,905
906,nostalgic,You sound like a caveman,Me found cave.,906
907,nostalgic,Why you no hunt and send wife instead.,Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.,907
908,excited,Oh I can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it  it can get really scary,One of the scariest  yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.,908
909,excited,You guys will be alright trust me I  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine. Our kid is a teenager now. I am happy for you guys,Oh  we were totally unprepared. In fact  my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!,909
910,grateful,Oh no! I'm not sure how all that works  but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman,When I was pregnant  I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.,910
911,grateful,Well I'm glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting,Usually the sickness stops within the first few months  so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all  I had a healthy  bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.,911
912,angry,That's so sad. You did your best. How old was she?,When my dog passed away  I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.,912
913,angry,That's really good  though. It sounds like you gave her a great life.,She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough  I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.,913
914,jealous,Was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?,I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him,914
915,jealous,In that case  you are better off without her. ,I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted,915
916,prepared,Oh  wow  I wish my parents had done that! It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now,My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs. ,916
917,prepared,Well  I've always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first 2 years as that's usually the break-in period. After that  the child should be able to manage,We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But  I know all parents aren't able to do that  or feel they shouldn't  so I can see both sides!,917
918,excited,I bet that felt good to get out and experience that!,After a long few months of being a hermit  I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!,918
919,excited,Oh I am sorry to hear that. I also enjoy dogs. They are one of life's great joys in my opinion.,It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.,919
920,sad,You should take a vacation that will help you relax and see new stuff,I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.,920
921,sad,Oh ok. In that case let someone very close like your mother come around to help you out. Having someone to talk to helps in times like this,I could definitely use one! However  I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!,921
922,content,That's awesome. Are you using any special types of lotion?,These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good  my family life is good  I've got good grades. Life is good!,922
923,content,I'll have to do the same! I wish my skin looked better than it does.,Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.,923
924,furious,You must be wealthy. I would love to visit NYC,I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.,924
925,furious,OMG! I know how you feel,I am  thanks  but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!,925
926,nostalgic,Oh  me too! I love digging out my N64 and SNES from time to time.,I just love playing retro games. Takes me back,926
927,nostalgic,Yes  that Yamaha sound chip was magical. We call it the Genesis over here.,Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games,927
928,terrified,Oh goodness  what was it?,One night  I was home alone  when suddenly  I heard a loud BANG!,928
929,terrified,Wow  that must have been a terrible experience.,It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate  and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window. ,929

932,disappointed,What does what mean exactly?,what does that mean?,932
933,disappointed,Well whatever went wrong  I hope it can be fixed somehow.,this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere,933
934,caring,Oh no! Did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?,A year ago  I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.,934
935,caring,Awe  that's a sweet story! The kitten got a happy ending!,I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat  Muffin. ,935
936,impressed,That's great! Who did the travelling?,I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all,936
937,impressed,She must be a strong woman.,Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!,937
938,apprehensive,Oh no. I hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on.,There was a storm the other day  close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it  so I was afraid and nervous!,938
939,apprehensive,That's good at least. Living in an area with tornados is so scary!,Yes  it luckily passed our home  but you just never know!,939
940,proud,Oh that is fantastic! I bet your brother was pretty happy too.,My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend  I'm really happy for him. :),940
941,proud,That is very sweet. I think they will have a happy and lasting marriage.,Yeah  he gave her my grandmothers rings  since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money  but still wanted her to have something nice.,941
942,excited,That's exciting! What kind are you looking for?,I can't wait to get a new car soon,942

944,prepared,OK  have you done the need full?,not yet ready for the baby  need fix up his room,944
945,prepared,OK get started already. A stich in time saves nine  !,Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!,945
946,annoyed,Oh I think I can guess which retailer you're talking about. I've had so many problems with them over the years,I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A  because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(,946
947,annoyed,I know. Canada isn't even overseas in the literal sense  it's just over the border!,Yeah  it's horrible. I mean  what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address  you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.,947
948,furious,Unbelievable. You must be very angry with her (whoever she is).,she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap,948
949,furious,Neither would I  I dislike such greedy people ,It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it,949
950,lonely,Wow that must have been frustrating.  I hope it didn't cost too much.,Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired,950
951,lonely,I know how that is.  At least you have your car back!,It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again,951
952,disappointed,I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds very rough. What happened to it?,For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies,952
953,disappointed,Oh jeez that's really awful. Can you get it back?,Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!,953
954,ashamed,What didn't she like?,At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it  that made me think differently,954
955,ashamed,Well that makes sense.,Well she had never done it before  so I thought it was special,955
956,proud,Congrats you have a baby on the way,I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant,956
957,proud,How many kids do you want in total?,Yes. It's a boy,957
958,anxious,Oh no. How did you handle having two such big priorities come up?,My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business. ,958
959,anxious,Oh  sorry to hear. I am sure your child was glad you were home. Is she or he feeling better now?,I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.,959
960,jealous,Sit where?,I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him,960
961,jealous,The club isn't a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways.  ,In the club,961
962,guilty,What happened!,I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to,962
963,guilty,This somehow seems inappropriate.,She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew,963
964,confident,What is your plan to accomplish that? ,I know I will save the money I need for the baby,964
965,confident,Just don't over do  you have to enjoy being a parent  that's a key to happy kids.,Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday,965
966,ashamed,Did you spill something?,I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out,966
967,ashamed,Was it liquid ?,Kinda. I thought it was a secret ,967
968,embarrassed,What was brutal?,it was brutal,968
969,embarrassed,Really? No shower for few days?,"""i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato"".",969
970,embarrassed,ok. I understand ,yes. homeless for a bit,970
971,guilty,i would feel terrible to thats really bad  you should just tell her and change! ,i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye,971
972,guilty,The truth can set us free  probably better for her and you both. ,it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her,972

977,guilty,oh.. well i understand. but that was a long time ago right?,i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents,977
978,guilty,come clean to them about any major lies  you'll feel better :),yeah  but still.. that feeling never went away,978
979,prepared,haha.. i feel you. my mom feels the same way,i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere,979
980,prepared,Amen sister! women always keep things in check,well  i guess women are more detail oriented,980
981,faithful,thats really good of you. she is a lucky gal,i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her,981
982,faithful,haha.. i guess she was not as good as your girl huh?,yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me  i escaped from there right awat,982
983,devastated,Oh no  I'm sorry to hear that. Are you considering getting a new dog?,my dog passed away earlier this year,983
984,devastated,I understand  mine just turned 15 and I'm not looking forward to that day.,yeah.. but its too soon i feel,984
985,angry,Jeez people just always have to be in a hurry to get no where right. ,some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious,985

987,apprehensive,What was that?,1,987

990,anxious,Great! I know it can be a tough job  I am sure you will do fine  keep studying!,I played a video game when I was younger  called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney  and it made me want to become one!,990
991,surprised,That sucks.,once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life,991
992,surprised,Well there are plenty more girls out there,yeah that really sucks.,992
993,embarrassed,Oh no. Did you leave?,I fell down at work  and my khaki pants ripped open.,993
994,embarrassed,Like you had a different kind of accident lol,I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.,994

996,joyful,Honestly that sounds pretty fun to me I havent been to bingo in years. I love listening to the older people arguing when someone wins. ,He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!,996

1015,grateful,wow thats great,I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal,1015

1023,grateful,That is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long! ,She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love)  but I wanted the upgraded version.,1023
1024,proud,That is SO exciting! I remember how that felt!,I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.,1024
1025,proud,That will come! The hardest part is over now!,I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.,1025
1026,anticipating,I remember how that felt! I always hated having to wait for grades.,"""I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday  and I am not sure what score I will receive.",1026
1027,anticipating,Awesome! Strategic Management sounds difficult by itself  I hope you get the grade you need!,I have  too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago  and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.,1027
1028,ashamed,That sounds awful. Are you going to see them again?,I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.,1028
1029,ashamed,It's probably best that you don't see them  then. Good thinking.,No  I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.,1029
1030,devastated,That must have been a difficult time for you.,My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away. ,1030
1031,devastated,The company you work for is horrible. They should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.,The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off,1031
1032,disgusted,Ew  that is not good! I wouldn't have been able to stay and eat.,I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.,1032
1033,disgusted,I do not blame you!,I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.,1033
1034,nostalgic,that is awesome  i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home,I recently returned to my childhood home  and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.,1034
1035,nostalgic,yes i was,Yes  it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?,1035
1036,sentimental,That is exciting! I love having pictures to look back on. ,I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone,1036
1037,sentimental,I love being able to reminisce on the past. Time goes by so fast. ,Yes  definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories  good times.,1037
1038,prepared,I had Hurricane Matthew come through where I live too! NE FL  I know how you feel  only I couldn't get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!,We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience  but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car  so could just leave.,1038
1039,prepared,Yeah you thought ahead  me not so much. Our house was fine but a HUGE mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days. I hope your house was ok too!,Oh  you poor thing! Thankfully  we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?,1039
1040,anxious,Was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?,I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.,1040
1041,anxious,Did everything go well or do you not know yet?,It started off as a checkup  but then they requested additional testing.,1041
1042,impressed,Oh man  I bet that is fun,My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!,1042
1043,impressed,No  I have always wanted one though,Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?,1043
1044,sad,Was it someone you know? Sorry for your loss if it was.,I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.,1044
1045,sad,I'm sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?,Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.,1045
1046,annoyed,Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of people's time,I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me,1046
1047,annoyed,Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait,I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing,1047
1048,annoyed,Wow! I would write a review  and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!,Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!,1048
1049,anticipating,Good luck! What is it on?,I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared  yet I am anxious.,1049
1050,anticipating,How much studying did you do leading up to it?,Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking. ,1050
1051,excited,Oh man  I bet that will be fun,I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach  Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago  and we loved it!,1051
1052,excited,I have  I love going when I can,We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?,1052
1053,surprised,That's really nice of him! How long have you been married?,One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!,1053
1054,surprised,Well you made the right choice in man to marry lol. What kind of necklace?,We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!,1054
1055,surprised,That either sounds like a locket  or a heart shaped key. Am I close at all?,It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?,1055
1056,surprised,Cool I think I saw a commercial for that actually.,Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top,1056
1057,embarrassed,Ut oh.. what happened?,I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.,1057
1058,embarrassed,hehehe.. don't mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... don't feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.  Those people don't know you or really care.  They laugh like I did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear. ,I dropped my money while my hands were full  ran into the door  and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.,1058
1059,jealous,What are you going to do about it,I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party  I suspect he is going to see someone,1059
1060,jealous,Well be careful for sure,I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution,1060
1061,jealous,I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever talked to your parents about that?,My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.,1061
1062,jealous,Yes  you do.Otherwise  you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life.,I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?,1062
1063,grateful,That is great that your hard work has paid off.,My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.,1063
1064,grateful,Now you having something to celebrate. Congrats!,Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately  but mine finally came through at a good time!,1064
1065,angry,Dont worry  anyone would have felt the same way. If it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once.,I was on an airplane last week  and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things  but it really bothered me.,1065
1066,angry,Yeah thats important  did you have music you could have listened to or something?,I tried to think about that  but I was still aggravated. On the plus side  at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.,1066
1067,faithful,Loyalty is a good thing,I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.,1067
1068,faithful,Oh wow  that is loyalty for sure,Yes  I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10 000 more a year than my current business is paying though.,1068
1069,grateful,I wish I had a grandma.. did she send you anything extra?,My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.,1069
1070,grateful,That is still really sweet.  I never knew any of mine.  Treasure her while you can!,I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card  but she is living on a fixed income.,1070
1071,terrified,Wow  must have been rather frightening. Glad you are ok!,A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter  but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.,1071
1072,terrified,I hope you have all the emergency essentials you need for next time.,Thank you! We were rather frightened  and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.,1072
1073,caring,Gardening can be peaceful,Hello the plants in my garden I water them  I move the earth  I try to keep them happy,1073
1074,caring,Nature is a wonderful thing,Especially when you feel something special by nature,1074
1075,prepared,Oh how exciting!  What do you have planned?,My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.,1075
1076,prepared,I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?,We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.,1076
1077,prepared,Well I'm sure everything will go great!,Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows  but I can't really tell for sure.,1077
1078,guilty,yeah that's tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?,Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!,1078
1079,guilty,That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. ,Yes  I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.,1079
1080,embarrassed,Oh wow  I have heard that can happen with that food,Last week I had Thai food for lunch  and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work  and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say  the stench ended the workday a little early.,1080
1081,embarrassed,Ha  that is funny,Yes  it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe',1081
1082,disgusted,ewww! that is just super gross dude!,I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom  ever!,1082
1083,disgusted,Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.,I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome  and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!,1083
1084,ashamed,I would love to have that tv,I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth  but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side  the 4k picture is astounding!,1084
1085,ashamed,Keep it  the guilt will go away,Yes  I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?,1085
1086,furious,Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.,it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.,1086
1087,furious,Exactly  sometimes I think women like drama.,Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.,1087
1088,nostalgic,It must have been fun to catch up with them.,I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.,1088
1089,nostalgic,Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.,it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now  so it was good to catchup.,1089
1090,joyful,Going to college is a good thing  but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.,I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.,1090
1091,joyful,That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.,Yes  exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance  two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!,1091
1092,grateful,That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?,Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.,1092
1093,grateful,I'm envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?,Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!,1093
1094,grateful,oh i know friends like those,My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness,1094
1095,grateful,i believe you,I wish they did not suffer  because it is my suffering,1095
1096,afraid,Oh wow  sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?,Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.,1096
1097,afraid,Did you have any damage to your home?,By the time we noticed how bad it was  we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.,1097
1098,lonely,That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?,I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.,1098
1099,lonely,I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?,No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed,1099
1100,sad,When did you get separated? By the way  that is terrible to hear.,Hi  I'm separated  I'm hurt and my heart is broken,1100
1101,sad,Why are you so down  my depressed friend?,one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel,1101
1102,disgusted,Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?,This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.,1102
1103,disgusted,Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!,Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.,1103
1104,disappointed,I hate to hear that  what happened that made it end poorly?,I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly  though  and things have not been the same since.,1104
1105,disappointed,maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.,We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.,1105
1106,angry,I know the feeling.,If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work  but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!,1106
1107,angry,"Leave a note on their door. and at the end put ""thanks in advance"" lol",You too  huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.,1107
1108,angry,Well  you can at least try. ,Nice idea  but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise  lol.,1108
1109,angry,You could get earplugs lol,I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!,1109
1110,apprehensive,Oh man! What happened to your hip?,I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes  but the suspense is killing me!,1110
1111,apprehensive,Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?,I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!,1111
1112,apprehensive,If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks  it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..,From what I've read  unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?,1112
1113,apprehensive,Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it  botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!,Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.,1113
1114,surprised,Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?,The weather here feels kinda mild today  I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.,1114
1115,surprised,Nice! Mowing the lawn isn't fun in the heat unless you're using a super fast one of course,I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.,1115
1116,anticipating,I agree  the writing part is easy part  but the speaking part is the worst!,Writing speeches makes me nervous,1116
1117,anticipating,Maybe so  they say to imagine the crowd naked  but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.,Yeah  it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience,1117
1118,nostalgic,Same. What are your favorites?,I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days  but they always bring back fond memories,1118
1119,nostalgic,That's funny. I've also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!,I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times  that and Harry Potter!,1119
1120,nostalgic,I've noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.,Yeah  sometimes there's more to those movies than you think  like they actually considered how adults would react,1120
1121,nostalgic,Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.,Yeah  maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything,1121
1122,hopeful,Yeah I get that. Where did you work?,Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life,1122
1123,hopeful,Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!,Dairy Queen  it was the only restaurant in my town,1123
1124,hopeful,Yes   work is better with friends.,True  most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.,1124
1125,hopeful,Really? I'm surprised the only restaurant in town wasn't busy.,Yeah  so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard  it wasn't too busy either,1125
1126,grateful,Did you see that happen today?,Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day,1126
1127,grateful,That's pretty cool.  What a nice person.,Yeah  someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!,1127
1128,apprehensive,Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?,Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking,1128
1129,apprehensive,That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?,I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill,1129
1130,embarrassed,Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?,When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks,1130
1131,embarrassed,Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.,Yeah  I'm not good with confrontations,1131
1132,confident,That's great.,I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good  I didn't know I was doing *that* well!,1132
1133,confident,Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.,Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!,1133
1134,confident,three years.,How long have you been there?,1134
1135,confident,I think I'm just going to move on.,I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?,1135
1136,joyful,Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?,My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!,1136
1137,joyful,That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.,Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries  but the rest - I should save it  my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.,1137
1138,proud,Cool. Does that get a bonus?,I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!,1138
1139,proud,That's awesome. ,I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*,1139
1140,proud,Well now you know you're pretty great at your job.,I'm just happy to be recognized  especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.,1140
1141,guilty,Was he upset?,So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.,1141
1142,guilty,I hate when that happens. ,"He kinda gave me the ""Mom  really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*",1142
1143,guilty,I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions,I do  too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].,1143
1144,guilty,You are so right.,It's easier with a list but still  you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD,1144
1145,guilty,Did you go back?,I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.,1145
1146,guilty,Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.,No  I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him  I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.,1146
1147,guilty,Or you can get a variety pack!,Multiple bags of chips  to be sure!  *chuckle*  ,1147
1148,grateful,That's nice. I could get that here.,My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.,1148
1149,grateful,Well now you know.,I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.,1149
1150,confident,Noice!  What was it about?,I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!,1150
1151,confident,Very cool  are you a scientist?,I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.,1151
1152,lonely,Oh no! That's awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.  How are you feeling?,I broke up with my boyfriend last week.,1152
1153,lonely,I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.,Well  I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online  the quiet is kinda loud.,1153
1154,proud,Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?,I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!,1154
1155,proud,That's an important job though!  You're keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  I'm so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!,I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL,1155
1156,content,I wish I could relate. I'm a male  so I'll never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It's such an impressive thing to go through  and no matter what  mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?,I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!,1156
1157,content,Yeah  I'll consider it. That's a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them  so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime  and they've given me lots of practice  but I'm grateful for that. 15 and 19  that's awesome. You're almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier.,15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful  as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?,1157
1158,surprised,It what?  Its way higher?  If that's what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.  ,Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is  it,1158
1159,surprised,It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn't even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it can't specifically tell. ,Yes  that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!,1159
1160,prepared,Wow  school is right around the corner,The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!,1160
1161,prepared,Well that should relieve some stress,It is! We actually got everything they need and more  except for a few notebooks. ,1161
1162,embarrassed,Everyone has those kinds of days  it happens,The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.,1162
1163,embarrassed,I am sure they have forgotten about it,It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything  shelves  displays and even the door when I was leaving. ,1163
1164,disappointed,Why not? What was wrong?,really didnt want to anything for days,1164
1165,disappointed,Aww I'm sorry. That's a bummer.,"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came  i had nothing to show for it"".",1165
1166,impressed,It sounds very motivational.,"I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district"".",1166
1167,impressed,He must be a great speaker.,it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now,1167
1168,anxious,What are you saving for?,I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time,1168
1169,anxious,I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.,Baby is due in less than 3 months,1169
1170,anticipating,I hope you did well on it.,I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me,1170
1171,anticipating,Just hope for the best and don't worry.,5 months to find out !,1171
1172,excited,That's great!  I'm happy for you.,I tried so hard for that exam  when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!,1172
1173,excited,What are those things?,thanks. now onto bigger things,1173
1174,surprised,That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!,it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting,1174
1175,surprised,It sounds like you live in a great community.,thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town,1175
1176,angry,Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!,I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this,1176
1177,angry,Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! ,Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym,1177
1178,content,I understand that. I am the same way.,I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change,1178
1179,content,I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.,Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.,1179
1180,proud,Unfortunately  I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. ,I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline ,1180
1181,proud,How so?,I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing,1181
1182,devastated,wow. When that happened?,the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls,1182
1183,devastated,Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.,Last week. we're in temporary housing now,1183
1184,guilty,It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this,I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!,1184
1185,guilty,That is pretty sad and heart-breaking to see kids in such situations,I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.,1185
1186,surprised,Do you have plans to get together? ,I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.,1186
1187,surprised,How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.,Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.,1187
1188,annoyed,There are usually many ways  but it depends on what you want to do!,I can't find another way to earn money,1188
1189,annoyed,Well  we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us,I just want to work from home,1189
1190,anticipating,That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare,I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now,1190
1191,anticipating,the buggy is important   I have a baby boy of my own.,You know  not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap,1191
1192,hopeful,Do you have a baby one the way?,I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials,1192
1193,hopeful,do you make enough money to support the baby?,I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back,1193
1194,jealous,oof that is rough.,She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.,1194
1195,jealous,those foids deserve it.,Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors ,1195
1196,ashamed,Yes  you only hurt yourself when you get angry.,I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding,1196
1197,ashamed,Give it some time  maybe she'll change her mind.,I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again,1197
1198,terrified,thats so sweet of you,I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.,1198
1199,terrified,oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine,She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.,1199
1200,confident,Wow. Do you expect to win?,I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!,1200
1201,confident,That is nice. Good luck.,I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.,1201
1202,sentimental,Nice  me too  are you playing Nintendo games?,I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro,1202
1203,sentimental,I remember these game well  like Contra and Battle Toads. ,Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation,1203
1204,apprehensive,Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?,I was so scared of going onto the train!,1204
1205,apprehensive,Was it your only choice to get where you were going?,No but I hate going in objects that travel fast  I really did not want to go on it.,1205
1206,excited,Great  what make are getting?,I am going to get us a new car!,1206
1207,excited,Toyota is reliable  are getting an SUV?,I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota,1207
1208,nostalgic,Interesting choice. Did she like it?,I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.,1208
1209,nostalgic,That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.,She loved it.  She's 17  I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.,1209
1210,joyful,So what is the problem exactly?,I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed,1210
1211,joyful,Try doing something you never did before.,I just feel kinda stuck in life,1211
1212,disgusted,It is disgusting. What did you do?,I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!,1212
1213,disgusted,You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.,I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.,1213
1214,excited,There are so many bike trails available now. You are going to have a lot of fun.,I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!,1214
1215,excited,I'm glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much.,I hope so  my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.,1215
1216,anticipating,That's a big step. I hope it works out for you.,Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon.,1216
1217,anticipating,I like renovation projects. And yes  renting is a waste of money,A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.,1217
1218,annoyed,I feel you  I'm in the same boat.  Are you in a two income household?,I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating,1218
1219,annoyed,Yep  money spent on bills and food  with little left for fun.  My wife has the same complaint. ,Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring,1219
1220,sad,Oh no  that sounds horrible,I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.,1220
1221,sad,I am sorry  that is a sad thing to go through,Yep  she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.,1221
1222,annoyed,Why would you not get paid?,I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.,1222
1223,annoyed,I can imagine it is,I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.,1223
1224,sentimental,Oh my  did it make you emotional?,I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.,1224
1225,sentimental,Aw hopefully you never lose that picture!,Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.,1225
1226,surprised,Oh what was the surprise?! ,I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.,1226
1227,surprised,You should go on a little date if you can. or to the movies!,Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous  but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.,1227
1228,afraid,You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.,Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town  I was a bit scared.,1228
1229,afraid,No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.,I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.,1229
1230,ashamed,did you pay him back?,When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.,1230
1231,ashamed,thats good thetn,No  I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it  it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent  its been 17 years now.,1231
1232,devastated,Oh my  so close! But you can try better next time.,I was one percent off from passing my math test  I was devastated.,1232
1233,devastated,Yes and theres no point mulling over it! ,I agree  I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!,1233
1234,terrified,wow thats crazy.. what ended up happening!,Last night I was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!,1234
1235,terrified,wow thats good,I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns  but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.,1235
1236,nostalgic,aww.. that must have been a sweet nostaligia. did you had a collection of those?,I was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! Finding those was like being a kid all over again!,1236
1237,nostalgic,I feel happy for ya! I used to collect cards myself  i still have them,I used to collect so many when I was younger  it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!,1237
1238,hopeful,That is great! Did you manage to land the job?,I was feeling so optimistic about getting a new job at Houston a while back,1238
1239,hopeful,I'm glad to hear that! As long as you keep working hard and trying your best you can do it! ,Yeah actually  i am still working on it. So much fun!,1239
1240,impressed,Are you talking about the city or a person?,I was so much in awe when i saw Hamilton!,1240
1241,impressed,I didn't know this broadway show but it seems nice.,Neither  i am talking about the broadway show :D,1241
1242,joyful,Yeah  I love going to the beach as well! You must have felt so happy there in that moment!,I went to the beach other day.. such an awesome feeling standing there,1242
1243,joyful,I feel happy and content just sitting here listening to you describe the experience.,I most certainly did.. There is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean.,1243

1247,excited,Well  a night out dancing will go a long way towards reconnecting with the love of your life.  I am happy for you!,We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.,1247

1249,sad,oh.. wow.. sorry that it happened.,She got run by a truck.. I felt guilty and blue,1249

1255,excited,Oh yea  he is too good at what he does. I heart stunning review for the show as well,Yeah  the same. Lin Manuel is a genius to say the least!,1255
1256,joyful,how did it turn out,I went to visit my family the other day,1256

1262,anxious,I feel you  it would be really scary. How did it turn out?,I was really nervous when i went to meet my girl's parents,1262

1264,terrified,Damn! was it a stray dog?,A dog chased me through our street last night,1264
1265,terrified,Dear god.. I hope you are alright my friend!,I think so.. it looked like that. I was shivering when i finally managed to escape,1265
1266,jealous,Oh really? I believe you wanted to be a singer yourself huh?,I really envy people who can sing,1266

1334,confident,Well  if you are willing to try steroids  then you might have a chance of winning. Without it  it is impossible to even participate,i wan to participate in a bodybuilding contest! I'm sure i will win it!,1334
1335,confident,Well in those contests  you have to be really pumped and by just fruits and vegetables  it is very unlikely,That's not true! I'm actually vegan and I don't make steroids and I looks pretty amazing. I don't need to use none to participate or win,1335

1338,lonely,Take joy and pride in the memories you have of him.  They are your personal family movies in your mind.  Cherish them because not everyone gets them with their parents.

1347,impressed,The rap version?   Doesn't sound all that appealing to me.  Was it that good?,i was so in awe when i saw hamilton,1347
1348,impressed,Maybe i'll have to check it out,It was really awesome dude  the full show covers it all up,1348
1349,proud,how did that go,I took my daughter out to the skate park today.,1349
1350,proud,oh thats awesome.. congrats,Awesome! She went down the big ramp today for the first time. It was so cool.,1350
1351,annoyed,Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement ,It really bothers me when people come into where we live at night and ride their dirt bikes,1351
1352,annoyed,for faith there is no path it is an individual human's thought ,There is many paths leading to faith,1352
1353,joyful,I am not  I am still young,Are you a parent.,1353
1354,joyful,I hope so  I am still not sure if I want kids,When you become one  you will never forget the day it happens. You'll weep of happiness.,1354
1355,anxious,I have anxiety attacks too   you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed.,I think i have anxiety attacks! I didn't even know that anxiety causes some physical pain. like the other day i felt like somebody was chocking me,1355

1357,anxious,Don't worry. It will be okay. Flights are always safe,We planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but I was so nervous about flying.,1357

1359,jealous,"That will be *such* a wonderful feeling when you do. I know it's hard when you see someone reach the ""finish line"" first -- are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?",My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down.,1359
1360,jealous,See? That's terrific! And she's got to love that you can celebrate her victories too -- even more inspiration to support yours!,I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal  and I genuinely am pleased she did it!,1360
1361,jealous,I'm like that too  so I can totally relate. Were you able to talk to him about how you felt?,I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.,1361
1362,jealous,I've felt the same way. As I have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself  those other insecurities and fears dropped off. Good for you for conquering that challenge!,Yes  but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly  it was more about my own insecurities than about him  you know? As I grew more into myself  the jealousy loosened its hold.,1362
1363,excited,Oh  that must be exciting! I bet you were busy making preparations.,My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.,1363

1366,disappointed,yea i can understand that,I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money  but he wastes it.,1366
1367,hopeful,Oh really? How did it go?,I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!,1367
1368,hopeful,Great job! I'm so happy for you! Losing weight is hard!,I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long. ,1368
1369,joyful,That sounds exciting! Congratulations to her. I bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!,I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice!,1369
1370,joyful,I bet! But at least now  like you said  she can see what hard work can achieve. Hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hope(d) for!,Absolutely! Of course  now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah  so happy for her!,1370
1371,surprised,Did that person betrayed you in any way?,I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.,1371
1372,surprised,Don't be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people.,"Well  in a sense. But to be fair  I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that  you know?",1372
1373,hopeful,I love reuniting with old friends  helps me remember and appreciate the good times.,I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!,1373

1375,confident,I'm sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! I'm positive you nailed it.,In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so.,1375
1376,confident,Being competitive isn't a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life. ,I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.,1376
1377,excited,How did you meet your friend?!,A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait!,1377
1378,excited,College and high school friends are always close to the heart. I'm glad she lives fairly close!,She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.,1378

1380,hopeful,I hope it goes as smooth as possible. Hang in there.,Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.,1380
1381,sad,Wait  were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest.,I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.,1381
1382,sad,It's like losing a family member :(,"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man  SO tough.",1382
1383,annoyed,What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?,My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.,1383

1385,jealous,How did they lose so much weight compared to you?,I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs  my friends made it to 15. :(,1385
1386,jealous,Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?,i guess they worked harder but,1386
1387,excited,Getting out of town and way from all of everday life's struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to 'really' get away from everything for a minute?,I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping  too!,1387
1388,excited,That sounds like a really relaxing time  I'm jealous.,Yes  sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.,1388
1389,angry,No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!,We paid 600$ for a cruise  but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad,1389
1390,angry,I hope that you win your money back and then some  you really deserve it after all of that upset!,we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company  so they dont know what they're in for,1390

1396,surprised,Oh  so you were able to get that spider away from you! Good job  hopefully that won't have to happen to you again!,I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.,1396
1397,hopeful,Wait  summers already over? Next summer?,I hope that this summer I can go to Florida with my family,1397

1400,furious,Yea man go for it  don't procrastinate.,I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.,1400
1401,devastated,Wow  that truly is devastating. I wish your family can make it through these hard times :(,I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.,1401
1402,devastated,If my sister died to breast cancer  I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. :(,My parents health has deteriorated rapidly  and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.,1402
1403,sad,Amen to that.Life is so unfair it's not even funny.,I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.,1403

1411,apprehensive,She really does need an intervention   and family and friends would help greatly   i hope she can get her life back together ,I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention  but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.,1411
1412,surprised,Oh my god  that's excellent! Congrats!,It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!,1412

1427,nostalgic,Do you still talk with any of your older friends?,I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.,1427
1428,nostalgic,Do you have little time from working or other things?,Yes  I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.,1428
1429,terrified,Yikes what was it about?,I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!,1429
1430,terrified,creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?,A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.,1430
1431,sentimental,That's great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.,I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary,1431
1432,sentimental,Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.,Yes  it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.,1432
1433,devastated,at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didn't suffer. i'm sorry you lost a loved one.,I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.,1433
1434,devastated,i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling,Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much,1434
1435,surprised,I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.,I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.,1435
1436,surprised,He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!,We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.,1436
1437,disappointed,Dang  that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?,Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!,1437
1438,disappointed,Ah  gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!,Yeah  hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.,1438
1439,sentimental,I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!,Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions,1439
1440,sentimental,Well  if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-),No  I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance,1440
1441,annoyed,That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.,I was recently working on a project where unfortunately  my teammate really didn't pull their weight.,1441
1442,annoyed,There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :),Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time  you don't want to complain about it  because it makes *you* look bad!,1442
1443,annoyed,I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?,I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.,1443
1444,annoyed,That sucks  I hope you get it figured out!,I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.,1444
1445,prepared,wow  it must have been quite an experience,Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash  water  important documents  a change of clothing.,1445
1446,prepared,My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe,It was enough to wake me  but not the cat  lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!,1446
1447,nostalgic,Awesome. What breed did you own?,I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times,1447
1448,nostalgic,I love paints  and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.,A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse ,1448
1449,prepared,10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own. ,The other day I had a flat  but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.,1449
1450,prepared,Practice makes perfect  or makes you fast in your case.,I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.,1450
1451,apprehensive,I would be too! Did you to it?,One time  my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous  naturally.,1451
1452,apprehensive,So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did? ,Yeah  I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.,1452
1453,jealous,You must be so proud!,My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!,1453
1454,jealous,I don't think you're being selfish  you're doing your best!,I am  but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here  bored stupid! I know  I'm being selfish.,1454
1455,anticipating,What state are you going to move to?,I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state  but should be interesting!,1455
1456,anticipating,Oh that is nice  will you be going skiing?,Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage  to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam  Zurich  and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state  it feels foreign somehow!,1456
1457,content,Who doesn't..  everyone should do it!  Have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?,I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate ,1457
1458,content,I hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating..,No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy. ,1458
1459,terrified,It must have being terrifying!,Once  I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.,1459
1460,terrified,Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.,Yes  I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.,1460
1461,disappointed,That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.,I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.,1461
1462,disappointed,I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!,Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.,1462
1463,anxious,oh  that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?,I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.,1463
1464,anxious,Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.,Honestly  I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.,1464
1465,impressed,That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?,I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer  despite being busy with other customers  took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful  kind man!,1465
1466,impressed,Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?,Not at all. They were super nice  and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.,1466
1467,impressed,I am in Central FL... so uhh.,Sure! There's plenty of room  lol. Just be sure you like hot  steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!,1467
1468,afraid,Ouch  I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.,I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.,1468
1469,afraid,Hmm  wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!,Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck,1469
1470,guilty,Ut oh.. what happened?,So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.,1470
1471,guilty,But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!,Luckily  they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.,1471
1472,sentimental,Ah  I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads  thinking the way we are now ;-)),I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days  when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.,1472
1473,sentimental,As long as you keep your playful spirit  you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness  but I can see it in you!,Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha,1473
1474,caring,It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?,I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.,1474
1475,caring,That sounds like a lot of fun  it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring  so I'm happy you have that job!,I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.,1475
1476,disappointed,What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?,I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed  frankly.,1476
1477,disappointed,Silver linings do happen  maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.,I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time  but I sure am wondering about my friendship!,1477
1478,disappointed,Maybe not a true friend after all.,Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate  which is not something I'd expect of him.,1478
1479,jealous,I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!,I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.,1479
1480,jealous,That's a lot of money  to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off  or perhaps she has kids to take care of?,She won $5 000 and never offered to share. ,1480
1481,prepared,Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?,I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.,1481
1482,prepared,Well done! You should be proud.,I wouldn't say naturally smart  it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.,1482
1483,hopeful,If I'm understanding you correctly  they're going to clean it up  right?,I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.,1483
1484,hopeful,Wow  that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?,Clean up  stabilize from future collapses  demolish vacant houses open closed roads  and so on,1484
1485,terrified,What did they or the person do to you?,I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am  I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly  out of the darkness  appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!,1485
1486,terrified,Broom would be a good choice  hit them in the crotch  that will stop them.,Well  I'm in a wheelchair  so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them  trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.,1486
1487,caring,That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?,My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.,1487
1488,caring,No  I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However  I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.,Actually  I did! I moved across the world to Doha  Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me  it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?,1488
1489,embarrassed,Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?,I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.,1489
1490,embarrassed,I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!,There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also  technical difficulties.,1490
1491,angry,Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.,Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!,1491
1492,angry,Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!,Exactly  I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving  which makes things even less safe ,1492
1493,proud,That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!,I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.,1493
1494,proud,Yes  I have! It's a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!,I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?,1494
1495,afraid,There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?,I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.,1495
1496,afraid,Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!,Fortunately  it didn't  but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!,1496
1497,sad,I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad  especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.,I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.,1497
1498,sad,I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.,Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness  imo.,1498
1499,prepared,That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?,My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt  left home early  and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.,1499
1500,prepared,Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!,I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.,1500
1501,excited,Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?,I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!,1501
1502,excited,Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!,I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides  roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?,1502
1503,prepared,Keep it up. Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.,I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.,1503
1504,prepared,Exactly  it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.,That may take awhile  but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.,1504
1505,surprised,That's fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?,We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.,1505
1506,surprised,Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!,Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa  but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.,1506
1507,angry,that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.,I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.,1507
1508,angry,oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.,That's horrible  but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained  but she clearly had not!,1508
1509,sentimental,What types of tv shows do you like to watch?,I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.,1509
1510,sentimental,Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?,Everything really  I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.,1510
1511,excited,Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.,I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!,1511
1512,excited,Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.,I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa? ,1512
1513,disgusted,Yea  I agree. Or they just really don't care.,Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.,1513
1514,disgusted,Did he even hesitate?,This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.,1514
1515,disgusted,What a little monster!,Not even a little.,1515
1516,trusting,Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?,I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.,1516
1517,trusting,Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.,Well  right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems,1517
1518,anxious,That's intense! I hope the damage wasn't all that bad.,I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house,1518
1519,anxious,Yes  get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?,It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.,1519
1520,nostalgic,Wow  you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.,I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.,1520
1521,nostalgic,Well  I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!,Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.,1521
1522,prepared,That sounds like fun  do you have a big family?,I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.,1522
1523,prepared,Yes I understand  I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.,No  I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family  you know?,1523
1524,impressed,Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?,I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.,1524
1525,impressed,thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer,She is very young  and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.,1525
1526,impressed,yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot,You know you could still do it. I know you can.,1526
1527,grateful,Aw  that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?,My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.,1527
1528,grateful,That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed,He lives about a couple hours away  but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!,1528
1529,hopeful,Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that  lol.,You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well  that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.,1529
1530,hopeful,Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!,It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though  and thanks for the advice.,1530
1531,disgusted,Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.,I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.,1531
1532,disgusted,You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.,Yes  it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.,1532
1533,proud,That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?,Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well  and I love going to see it.,1533
1534,proud,I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?,It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages  to jewelry and lots of other things.,1534
1535,proud,I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!,I have another job so I can't do too much  but I love going in to see her. ,1535
1536,lonely,Wow  I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.,I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!,1536
1537,lonely,I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad  and I'm glad that you adapted well.,It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!,1537
1538,lonely,I think I might. It sound exciting  and I thank you for the encouragement.,Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!,1538
1539,caring,That's unfortunate  but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out.,I recently got very sick  and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.,1539
1540,caring,I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side., Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.,1540
1541,disgusted,I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently? ,I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior  simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.,1541
1542,disgusted,Yes  I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!,We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!,1542
1543,surprised,Wow  that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?,So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.,1543
1544,surprised,Ah  maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. ,He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here  and he's only ever had one friend over.,1544
1545,furious,It should be harder to get a license than it is.,I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.,1545
1546,furious,It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.,I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?,1546
1547,afraid,Oh my gosh  I'm so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed? ,You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.,1547
1548,afraid,They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.,She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.,1548
1549,anxious,Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.,I've been passively job hunting for a few months now  looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.,1549
1550,anxious,Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter  and don't ever give up!!,Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too. ,1550
1551,proud,That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?,One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.,1551
1552,proud,As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!,She told me she wants to become a dentist  but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year. ,1552
1553,prepared,it has been really busy even for me at work   i feel your pain,June and July are very busy  June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.,1553
1554,prepared,I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol,So much for relaxing during the summer?,1554
1555,terrified,Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. ,Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.,1555
1556,terrified,I think I would pass out from fear lol.,It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.,1556
1557,terrified,I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.,You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.,1557
1558,impressed,That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?,I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food,1558
1559,impressed,That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.,I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all,1559
1560,trusting,I have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly.,I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.,1560
1561,caring,That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?,When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.,1561
1562,caring,That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.,I was and she was had a full recovery. ,1562
1563,caring,Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.,Me neither  my mom means so much to me. ,1563
1564,caring,Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.,Do you get to see your mom often?,1564
1565,impressed,Those cars are pretty slick  what color was it?,I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!,1565
1566,impressed,Wow  one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that  that's awesome,It was blue with white racing stripes. ,1566
1567,angry,UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.,My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.,1567
1568,angry,I dont really like dogs for that reason.  They are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore.,This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.,1568
1569,surprised,That sounds like you have a great wife.  What did she make you?,My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.,1569
1570,surprised,Yummy  You are making me hungry.  Happy belated birthday!,She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert. ,1570
1571,surprised,I always love pizza!,Thank you! What is your favorite meal?,1571
1572,sad,when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies   for some reason the sad movies made me cry  but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new,My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.,1572
1573,sad,it happens to the best of us  and i totally understand where your coming from   spend some time with your friends or loved ones ,I know  it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together. ,1573
1574,grateful,What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.,My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry. ,1574
1575,grateful,That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts ,He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.,1575
1576,excited,Congratulations! Sounds like you're ready for the new position.,I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility. ,1576
1577,excited,What is your work area?,Thank you  I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.,1577
1578,proud,That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn't know that they already knew! ha ha  that's a tongue twister.,My daughter can say so many new words  love to see her thrive!,1578
1579,proud,I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what you're saying.  How old is your daughter?,Yes  thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?,1579

1583,grateful,I love sushi.  Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?,Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.,1583
1584,grateful,Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.,I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had  haha.,1584
1585,content,Very nice  wind in your hair  exercise  and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?,So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!,1585
1586,content,I am actually home bound  but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!,It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?,1586
1587,lonely,I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.,It's so quiet in my house  just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.,1587
1588,lonely,You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support  no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!,That is a great attitude to have  my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2 000 miles away in Alaska!,1588
1589,trusting,You sound like you're embracing life!,Whenever we moved abroad  I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.,1589
1590,trusting,Where did you move to?  I feel you. I am in the same place.  Just reversed 13 years of Lupus suffering by going plant based and now I want to live and see the world! I would love to move to Italy.,Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time  so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.,1590
1591,jealous,Oh wow  I'd be really jealous of him.,It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.,1591
1592,jealous,Well  hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon.,I certainly am! Of course  I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.,1592
1593,joyful,That is nice.,So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!,1593
1594,joyful,I have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own ,Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?,1594
1595,surprised,Its always nice to catch up,I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.,1595
1596,surprised,I hope you keep doing thaty,Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.,1596
1597,sentimental,Same here. I actually moved to the other side of the USA  and I do miss my home,I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!,1597
1598,sentimental,Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!,Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same  you know?,1598
1599,faithful,Were you happy about that  or creeped out?,I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman. ,1599
1600,faithful,You're a good guy. Did she take it well?,I respectfully told her I was not interested  I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.,1600
1601,impressed,That's really awesome that you supported your friend!,I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!,1601
1602,impressed,I'm sure he really appreciated you support too!,I am very glad that I went and supported him.,1602
1603,lonely,Aw  I'm sorry. I know this isn't the best solution  but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?,Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday  such as christmas  I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.,1603
1604,lonely,No problem! I know you can't always fix everything  but it's worth trying wierd ideas every now and then,No I haven't  but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!,1604
1605,confident,Oh wow  I love that kind of sauce,So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!,1605
1606,confident,That isnt long at all,Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.,1606
1607,hopeful,It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.,I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?,1607
1608,hopeful,I hope you get your promotion.,Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.,1608
1609,anticipating,Oh man  your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born  I was just as pumped  full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. It's such a long ride until they're able to even remotely look after themselves.,I am so excited for my baby son to be born  I am so eager for it to happen!,1609
1610,anticipating,I know you have a lot of work ahead of you  but I'm sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man  I can't imagine what you'll have to go through  or what you will enjoy  but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child.,I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.,1610
1611,afraid,Did it scare you?,So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.,1611
1612,afraid,Yes  a little bit. When I was young  I didn't like that much scary movies.,Yes  I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?,1612
1613,anticipating,Whats your favorite team?,I'm ready for football season to start  NFL preseason started this week  and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!,1613
1614,anticipating,Well for me  in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too.,In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama,1614
1615,impressed,That's pretty cool. I bet it's pretty difficult to do something like that.,I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike  it was insane!,1615
1616,impressed,I'd love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself  but I'm not sure if there's any locations near me.,I agree  years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV,1616
1617,grateful,Aw I am sorry that happened to you. I hope the repair didn't cost you too much! ,My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.,1617
1618,grateful,Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up  so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours. ,It was just the carburetor  which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.,1618
1619,content,Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?,I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!,1619
1620,content,That's great! Hard work pays off I guess.,I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.,1620
1621,devastated,Oh I'm sorry.  How are his family doing?,My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago  I'm still in shock.,1621
1622,devastated,It's pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friend's buddies died in a car crash as well.,They've been really closed up about the whole thing  I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time  I could not imagine.,1622
1623,surprised,Woah  that is huge news. How are you handling the news.,I realized yesterday I was pregnant  I was in shock!,1623
1624,surprised,I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!,I am still in awe  I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.,1624
1625,prepared,That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare. ,When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area  I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood. ,1625
1626,prepared,That is very smart thinking!,I had an emergency generator  extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.,1626
1627,guilty,How old were you? If you were a kid  that deserves a pass!,I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once  I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.,1627
1628,guilty,You live and you learn  at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!,I was 17  at that age I should of known better.,1628
1629,caring,That's sweet of you  the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!,My friend has had the flu  and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.,1629
1630,caring,That's good  at least he is getting better  he'll survive!,Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well  just whiny. ,1630
1631,proud,There's nothing wrong with that,I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school  I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.,1631
1632,proud,You should celebrate too. I would,I'm just happy that I got it  it took a lot of hard work.,1632
1633,nostalgic,That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?,The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.,1633
1634,nostalgic,Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends. ,Yeah  it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it  making fun of the movie while it was on.,1634
1635,anxious,I too feel the same. What did happen at last?,I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.,1635
1636,anxious,Yeah  very good to hear! congrats!,The interview went well and I ended up getting the job  so I guess I worried for nothing :),1636
1637,annoyed,Eww  I hate neighbors that have no class.,The other day I had to take my dogs out before work  but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.,1637
1638,annoyed,Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.,She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work  but not this time.,1638
1639,embarrassed,How awful! Please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?,I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.,1639
1640,embarrassed,Embarrassing things happen to all of us!,Now I can laugh  but when I was on the floor I was not laughing  I just wanted to leave.,1640
1641,proud,Amazing! I wish I could see a pic of it!,My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!,1641
1642,proud,Oh he will be  but enjoy it  only babies once,He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy,1642
1643,nostalgic,that's a pretty long date! Where did you guys go?,When my wife and I started dating  our second date ended up lasting like 12 hours.,1643
1644,nostalgic,That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!,Lunch  a zoo  my apartment for a while  and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P,1644
1645,devastated,That's terrible.  Was he already very sick?,Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning  he did not go easily :(,1645
1646,devastated,Im sorry he went through that.,Yeah  he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.,1646
1647,anticipating,Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that? ,I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail,1647
1648,anticipating,Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo. ,Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one,1648
1649,nostalgic,How does that make you feel? Is that a dealbreaker,I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus,1649
1650,nostalgic,Ah  I guess you have to save money somewhere,Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is! ,1650
1651,sentimental,Oh no I am sorry to hear about that  were you together long?,I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard,1651
1652,sentimental,That's good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship,Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now,1652
1653,embarrassed,That is embarassing  but a good story at least!,I was out at dinner with my family  and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.,1653
1654,embarrassed,That is for sure  you can always count on parents for that,Yeah  it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P,1654
1655,nostalgic,IT does go fast. I was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!,We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller  and how time flies by so fast!,1655
1656,nostalgic,I miss being called mommy. One day you'll be called grandma,I know  that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!,1656
1657,embarrassed,that is embarassing  but were you at least okay?,The last time I went to the fair  I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!,1657
1658,embarrassed,Well maybe they found that endearing in a way!,I scuffed my knees a bit  but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked  so that made it even worse. But  I jumped up super quick lol,1658
1659,guilty,How old were you when you did it?,i stold some spare change from my parents,1659
1660,guilty,That was nice to repay them back with dinner,maybe like 19  but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner,1660
1661,lonely,i'm sorry to hear that. i know exactly what you are going through. My brother tragically passed away 2.5 years ago. He was only 32,My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.,1661
1662,lonely,I know how hard it was for you. My parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldn't even go there at that time to be with them. I felt heartbroken and alone,Yes  I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically  that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life  which my mother and I found her  and it was very hard for us all. But  I couldn't burden my parents with my pain  I felt.,1662
1663,grateful,To thank whom?,Having a good job is something to thank,1663
1664,grateful,Is that who got you the job?,to life God to that higher energy,1664
1665,grateful,What job do you have?,Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful,1665
1666,grateful,Are you in a union?,I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company,1666
1667,devastated,did you find it ?,I was devastated when I lost my phone,1667
1668,devastated,well thats good,I did but it took a while ,1668
1669,surprised,how old did you turn ?,I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party,1669
1670,surprised,congrats,I turned 34,1670
1671,sad,When will you be able to visit?,i didn't see my parents since 2014! I miss them so much. it's so sad that i live in a different country,1671
1672,sad,Oh boy  that must be amazing for him,actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him,1672
1673,annoyed,what did you end up watching instead,I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on,1673
1674,annoyed,thats cool,I ended up watching Impractical Jokers,1674
1675,confident,Oh yeah  that's always nice. Sometimes they just don't get it  though.,I love when I need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch.,1675
1676,confident,Wow  you sound pretty confident! You must really know what you're talking about.,Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.,1676
1677,anxious,I am afraid to fly too.,I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.,1677
1678,anxious,I know right  planes make me nervous.,I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.,1678
1679,guilty,Uh oh. I bet she wasn't happy when she found out.,I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.,1679
1680,guilty,Yeah  I can understand that.... But it probably would have been best to invite her anyway  just in case.,No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.,1680
1681,joyful,that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.,My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.,1681
1682,joyful,mine is going crazy with mosquitos,I wish I could more often  but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.,1682
1683,joyful,i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside,ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.,1683
1684,trusting,What does your husband do for work?,My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage  but after almost 23 years of marriage  I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.,1684
1685,trusting,My uncle use to be an iron worker  so I know exactly what you are talking about.,He is an iron worker  so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings. ,1685
1686,jealous,That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. ,"I've been married almost 23 years  but many years ago  my husband was acting a bit too ""chivalrous"" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice  but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice'  which made me feel a bit upset. ",1686
1687,jealous,Well it's nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man. ,Well  we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there  and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated  but he was very insistent about it  even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.,1687
1688,impressed,What is her best talent?,My niece is super talented lately.,1688
1689,impressed,Does she draw or paint? How any students are in this program?,Art  she was accepted into a special program for high school.,1689
1690,angry,That is terrible.  I don't know why teenage boys can be so mean.  What did you end up doing?,One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say  I was very  very upset!,1690
1691,angry,That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you don't have to deal with it again  though.,I actually knew his father  so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again  I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her  as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.,1691
1692,lonely,I'm sorry  what is his job?,I really dont like my husbands job right now.,1692
1693,lonely,Hopefully they will give him a better shift.,Retail  but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks,1693
1694,hopeful,Hey that's awesome!!!  What are you planning to buy with it?,Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next. It's not promised  but it has happened for several years now. I am really wishing it will be this year too!,1694
1695,hopeful,That's an awesome  very adult thing to do!  Congrats!,Well  we have college tuition  just got back from an expensive beach vacation  etc. So  if anything replenish some savings  right!,1695
1696,disgusted,I don't like them either. It makes me sick.,I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!,1696
1697,disgusted,Oh my gosh! That is disgusting!,Yes  I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!,1697
1698,anxious,What does your husband do for a job?,My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year  but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting  and not knowing!,1698
1699,anxious,You already told me that. Is he in sales or something similar?,My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year  but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting  and not knowing!,1699
1700,lonely,that is no good! you need someone to be there and take care of you.,I've been married a long time  but my husband is gone quite a bit for work. I feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(,1700
1701,lonely,I have never been married  so i cant imagine   but I would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day.,Luckily  my children still live at home  but it's not quite the same. Plus  it won't be too long before they are ready to move out,1701
1702,nostalgic,It is so hard and so rewarding to see them grow up. ,My youngest child started high school this year. It really made me think back to her starting kindergarten  and how time really goes by. I can just see her learning to read!,1702
1703,nostalgic,I bet.  I really want to hold on to mine forever  but I know that they need to grow up.  I hope you are still able to make memories with yours even as they are getting older.,Yes  it really is bittersweet. But  the older they get  the easier it is to think back to the younger days!,1703

1871,sentimental,What a great idea  where did that come from?,The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.,1871
1872,sentimental,Well I need to keep that in mind  great suggestion ,Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it  so I don't really know which one  but you can find a bunch on there.,1872
1873,confident,Oh wow  what a long trip. How long did it take?,Well  what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems  and I was right.,1873
1874,confident,That is a long time to be in the car for sure.,Six days in all  but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.,1874
1875,confident,Oh well that's a plu!,It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas  some with free coffee!,1875
1876,confident,So where did you stop along the way?,Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!,1876
1877,hopeful,Well at least you have a plan. Are you planning to start the renovation soon?,I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.,1877

1883,lonely,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever been married?,I hope when I get older  Im not lonely as I am now,1883
1884,lonely,I'm so sorry. It wasn't meant to be.,I was engaged but my woman left me,1884
1885,nostalgic,That's such a good tune.,I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.,1885
1886,nostalgic,Yeah  it's definitely a classic. It reminds me of my childhood as well.,Yeah  for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.,1886
1887,guilty,Maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated  without showing anger.,I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.,1887
1888,guilty,Yeah  just stay positive about it  I'm sure you'll figure something out.,True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.,1888
1889,afraid,Was it just a bad feeling you had?,K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there  but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.,1889
1890,afraid,Maybe someone died there,It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.,1890
1891,annoyed,Oh yeah  the buffering?  Very annoying.,I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.,1891
1892,annoyed,I hear that.  Sometimes the classics are impossible to find.,Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie  and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.,1892
1893,proud,Did you get her something special?,My eldest niece  who helps take care of her younger disabled sister  graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.,1893
1894,proud,Oh awesome  That is great!,Yes  I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland  so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.,1894
1895,apprehensive,You wont know an answer if you dont ask,I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.,1895
1896,apprehensive,Just play it safe,Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.,1896
1897,disappointed,That sucks  after going all that way too and you didn't even get to try it. I'm sorry.,I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it  what a waste of time,1897

1899,disgusted,That's funny.,My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.,1899
1900,disgusted,Wonder if it has to do with his diet?,Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.,1900
1901,sad,Will he be back soon?,It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.,1901
1902,sad,Okay  I see. That must be hard.,I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(,1902
1903,embarrassed,I think we've all done a version of that.,I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.,1903
1904,embarrassed,ha  that's too funny.,I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.,1904
1905,lonely,That sounds tough :-(  does he get back soon?,It's been a hard day today  its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.,1905

1908,caring,That sounds pretty serious  glad she is okay now!,Chest infection which  for her  can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.,1908
1909,furious,What sort of issues?,I have this cat that loves to cause issues ,1909
1910,furious,Cats are always getting into things and causing destruction.,Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table ,1910
1911,devastated,Oh no  could you ask your supervisor for guidance?,I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.,1911
1912,devastated,Sounds like you have a good plan. I wish you the best,Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.,1912
1913,surprised,That was very sweet. What movie did you want to watch?,I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet,1913
1914,surprised,Oh ok! The gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want',it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already,1914
1915,annoyed,So you covered him. It was very noble from your side to act in this way,A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would. ,1915
1916,annoyed,Well  at least you did something good for that co-worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you,It was  but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker. ,1916
1917,disappointed,So you have to wait a week longer to see her again? That stinks.,My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.,1917
1918,disappointed,Yeah  I can imagine. At least it's only one week!,Yeah.  It could be worse  but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.,1918
1919,grateful,Great to hear that.I hope you enjoy your new life.,It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.,1919

1922,sad,That is so sad. I had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up.,Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.,1922
1923,furious,Yeah I understand.  Are there any charities nearby that you could volunteer for?,It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street,1923
1924,furious,Well that's good of you.  Do you think homelessness is due to mental incapacities?,I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity,1924
1925,surprised,Why did he do that?,My husband shocked me the other day ,1925
1926,surprised,Oh my  did you have a good time?,He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death! ,1926
1927,faithful,I don't understand that either. It really makes you sick to think about. Have you experienced this?,I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.,1927
1928,faithful,No I have not. I would never participate in that either. My wife and I are extremely happy together.,No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?,1928
1929,disappointed,It always seems to work out like that doesn't it?,I was planning to view the stars last night  but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.,1929
1930,disappointed,I may have to check that out as well.,It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.,1930
1931,jealous,Yes  but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well.,A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.,1931
1932,jealous,Yes  the first years of a baby's life  the mother pretty much spends entirely with them. The husband is kind of left out in the cold.,Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.,1932
1933,caring,That is wonderful! Moms are truly a gift! I miss my Mom at times. We are workcamping in the mountains of NM and my Mom lives in TX.,My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!,1933
1934,caring,We have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol. Now that we are fulltime RVers  they dont follow. I miss that sometimes. I am glad you have your Mom close! Cherish those times!!,I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.,1934
1935,lonely,Wow  yes  I always feel the same way! I would love to pass of grocery shopping to someone else.,I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.,1935

1950,jealous,I can understand that. I actually broke up with a previous girlfriend over the same type of thing.,Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her,1950
1951,surprised,Oh that must have been so exciting and surprising! ,When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!,1951
1952,surprised,Did you all do some fun things while he was there?,It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!,1952

2011,anticipating,that makes it very difficult  and hard not to get your hopes up,It is! It's not a guarantee though  so it's just a waiting game  and not easy.,2011
2012,angry,Oh wow! I would be very angry as well! Unless it was some kind of emergency or extenuating circumstance,I am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party,2012

2031,annoyed,that makes the situation worse when your expectations are through the roof,Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.,2031

2034,surprised,It is pretty crazy how fast grow up when you get older  it seems like a couple of weeks and they are in high school,i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing,2034
2035,surprised,That's definitely a factor  sometimes I forget about some of my nephews even exist.,yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him,2035
2036,angry,I am so sorry to hear that. No one should have to go through something like that.,When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.,2036
2037,angry,I'm sure I would have done the same thing! But stay strong  many people have beaten cancer! Keep a positive attitude and stay by her side!,It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.,2037
2038,proud,that was an awesome day for me too  hard to believe it was nearly  10 years ago,one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school,2038

2041,disappointed,Is your car still drivable?,I know  I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving  ,2041
2042,prepared,Good thinking.  You can never be too prepared  only under prepared.,There is a tornado coming. But I have the pantry full and am ready this time.,2042
2043,prepared,Yep! or if you're house will be hit.  Many possibilities with tornadoes!,You never know how long the power might be out for! ,2043
2044,surprised,oh my goodness. what a blessing,I had a pretty large loan  with a bit of a high interest rate  and a high monthly payment. My mother decided to pay it off for me  out of the blue!,2044

2047,faithful,i am sorry to hear about that! i hope everything gets better for you!,I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring,2047
2048,disappointed,oh no  I hope you did any sustain any injury,I left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me. I couldn't believe I would do that.,2048

2050,terrified,that makes two of us! i am terrified of all snakes,I have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them,2050
2051,terrified,eww thats disgusting  and makes it worse it was a poisonous snake,yes  i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends,2051

2054,afraid,really why is that?,I was afraid when I went into the movies alone,2054

2064,surprised,You are pretty lucky!,I felt pretty luck the other day! I won $100 on a scratch off ticket! I never win!,2064
2065,surprised,Maybe I should buy some. I never win either. Its about time,Not usually  I never win. so  it was very unexpected.,2065
2066,jealous,I am sorry  maybe she will share?,My sister was given $1 000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.,2066
2067,jealous,That is infair,Perhaps  I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.,2067
2068,disappointed,I hate when that happens! Especially when you have been waiting for the beach!,We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!,2068
2069,disappointed,That's what matters most  that you had a good time and made memories!,Yes  and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But  we still had a good time  just wished we could have had less rain!,2069
2070,grateful,Congratulations! I'm sure you earned it!,I was given the opportunity to work at a new job that I was hoping to get! I never thought it would be possible!,2070

2073,embarrassed,I can understand that!,No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.,2073
2074,lonely,I bet that is a rough schedule.,My husband works nights a lot right now.,2074
2075,lonely,Does he get any nights off?,It really is  i hate being alone at night.,2075
2076,apprehensive,It sounds like a great chance to start over fresh! Where are you moving to?,I'm anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move -- we've lived overseas before  but this is such a different state and climate  I'm not sure what to expect!,2076

2096,grateful,That is great! I know my sister has had help with that a lot too! It can get expensive. You know they have new clothes from target at goodwill a lot  that helps with spending ,My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.,2096
2097,grateful,it's like $5 for new clothes  good quality a lot. Great! Yes it is a lot to buy clothes for ever growing kids,Yeah  it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.,2097
2098,grateful,THAT is the spirit of a true giver and the only one I would take a gift from! Great in laws!,Wow  those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah  the best part about them helping  is that they do it  not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.,2098
2099,angry,That is despicable. Did you report her to the teacher?,I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own  stealing all the work I had done.,2099
2100,angry,She could drop her from the class and give her an F!,I did.  There wasn't much she could do  but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.,2100
2101,anxious,Me too! Who did this to you?,i really hate when people make me wait for no reason,2101
2102,anxious,I understand that! When I am ready to go- I just want to hurry up and go. I hate sitting around waiting too. Maybe you should make her wait and see if she likes it. Lesson ,my girlfriend allways makes me wait  it makes me really anxious ahhahah,2102
2103,sad,That's so sad! Can you email them?,One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again,2103
2104,sad,Can you see him before he goes?,yeah i can call him and email him  it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again,2104
2105,proud,Hey  that's pretty good. Do you have any goals set for yourself?,I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.,2105
2106,proud,Well I hope yours work out as well. Focusing on the goals of others probably gives you a lot of inspiration.,Very similar ones  but I like focusing on others success,2106
2107,sad,Oh I know! I could kill people like that.,i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it,2107
2108,sad,And they don't have a voice of their own.,i know right  it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me,2108
2109,proud,Congratulations! What made it so great?,the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day,2109
2110,proud,Ah  well you earned it!,the fact that it took so much work and time,2110

2113,caring,Thats very admirable of you.  How do you help her?,I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago. ,2113
2114,caring,We need more people like you in the world.  Theres always someone out there who needs a helping hand and could use a friend.,We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.,2114
2115,terrified,I totally agree. People are too divided by their political views these days.,We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues  no matter your views.,2115
2116,terrified,Everyone is always fighting over these things  it's a sad thing to see.,Exactly  let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!,2116
2117,lonely,Oh! pity about you. ,I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab  working by myself.,2117
2118,lonely,Hope you had good time after your work!,Yes  it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.,2118
2119,sentimental, I am so sorry to hear that.,I miss my dog Kat,2119
2120,sentimental,I hope you find a new puppy love soon.,Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog,2120
2121,impressed,I am glad to hear that!  What is happening with him?,It's great to see my husband doing so well.,2121
2122,impressed,That is awesome!  I hope he got a good raise,He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.,2122
2123,furious,I can't imagine why people would do that. Animals are helpless.,Hello  I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable,2123
2124,furious,You're very empathetic then! I hate seeing animals suffer as well.,I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit,2124
2125,terrified,Hiking is probably a tough environment to meet people! LA is real nice  but I hear the people there aren't/,That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark. ,2125
2126,terrified,That's cool! Did you end up keeping up with them after you left?,Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also. ,2126
2127,sentimental,Thats sweet to have such a memory of her. Did she pass away then? ,I really miss my puppy  we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.,2127
2128,sentimental,Im so sorry  pets are like children ,Yes  she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.,2128
2129,caring,Teething is a hard period for babies and moms,my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don,2129
2130,caring,Poor baby. I remember my kids teething too. It was horrible,it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good  doesn't want to eat. poor little boy,2130
2131,disappointed,Ha ha  I'm sure he'll get the the hang of it eventually. It takes some children longer than others to get used to.,i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college,2131
2132,disappointed,I'm not looking forward to it when I have a kid! I can't function without a good 8 hours of sleep.,I hope so  i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face,2132
2133,jealous,How does that make you feel ?,I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.,2133
2134,jealous,I've never left the US. I've never been north of Kentucky.,I wish I were with them.  I love Italy,2134
2135,jealous,I've spent my life turning my home into where I want to be  instead of where I want to leave.,Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.,2135
2136,grateful,That was nice. What did you have?,My friend bought me lunch today,2136
2137,grateful,That sounds good. I bet it was fun to hangout and eat with your friend.,I had a nice burger and fries,2137
2138,furious,It is very annoying! I hate it too,I hate when people pull in front of you  especially when it's clear behidn you.,2138
2139,furious,Some people should not be allowed to drive! We were rear ended 2 times last months! Can you believe that,Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.,2139
2140,afraid,That;s ok  everyone has some kinda fears that make little sense to others.,I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy,2140
2141,afraid,Hey  I can't sleep without socks. It's no big deal.,That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on,2141
2142,caring,That is really nice of you! I am sure they appreciate it,I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.,2142
2143,caring,They get to enjoy themselves and have a good time! :),They do. They get to smell the grass  they play they get their exercise  they get to have fun  they get to be a dog! ,2143
2144,afraid,Oh no  did you have candles and flashlights available?,Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street,2144
2145,afraid,Good thing  you have to be prepared for those situations,We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power,2145
2146,furious,Oh I am so sorry. Cats can be very mischievous sometimes. ,A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.,2146
2147,furious,Yea I feel you. At the end of the day you cant blame the cat. It didnt do this on purpose.,I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it,2147
2148,disgusted,Man I'm sorry to hear that...I've wasted a good protein shake doing that once,I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross! ,2148
2149,disgusted,Oh well I was starving...I just rinsed it out with some mouthwash and ordered a big pizza lol,don't you hate that? gosh  i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore,2149
2150,content,I use to live in an older house that had a tin roof  and I'd always love hearing the rain beat on it! Helped me sleep like a baby .,I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows ,2150
2151,content,I wonder if that's a common thing? It's very relaxing.,It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too! ,2151
2152,anxious,I'm sorry for that. Have you tried going to therapy?,i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere,2152
2153,anxious,I'm so sorry but you'll get there in time.,not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up ,2153
2154,excited,I've never gambled. What happened when you were playing video poker? And is it fun?,Though the odds are against you  I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.,2154
2155,excited,Wow  check out Mr. Moneybags over here! That must have been a real thrill though.,Well  take this with a grain of salt  but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do  and on the first deal  I hit $1000. I went nuts  cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!,2155
2156,surprised,Yes  it does seem like a fun place. I would love to go to the Mardi Gras.,I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.,2156
2157,surprised,That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I would have seen it!,Mardi Gras is great  but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town  and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole  and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!,2157
2158,furious,I'd say that'd be a real disappointment to say the least.,I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?,2158
2159,furious,End of friendship.,You can say that again. One time  I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.,2159
2160,ashamed,I am not quite sure what you mean by that?,1,2160
2161,ashamed,That's OK  It happens to the best of us!,sorry that was sent by an mistake,2161
2162,disgusted,oh that little unfair,I don't think I am a judgmental person  but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day  and I can still smell it.,2162
2163,disgusted,oh enjoy dude,Trust me  this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off  they had running clean water  but no toilet indoors! ,2163
2164,confident,Congrats! How do you feel about it? And what is the presentation on?,I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.,2164
2165,confident,It's good that you worked hard on it. I hope you get a raise or a bonus for your labor!,I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.,2165
2166,annoyed,I think so.  Sometimes our friends show us sides of them that they rarely show other people.,Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?,2166
2167,annoyed,Did you make the party anyway?,That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!,2167
2168,surprised,Wow. That is a blessing,Not too long ago  my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it! ,2168
2169,surprised,I am going to always take care of my kids like that,Yes  I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought  I am blessed.,2169
2170,grateful,I hate doing dishes any way,I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible ,2170
2171,grateful,That's sweet,I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me! ,2171
2172,proud,Cool I just finished today,So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!,2172
2173,proud,Yeah we had a hard time today lol,I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.,2173
2174,proud,I am going to do like you next year for sure!,And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!  ,2174
2175,devastated,That happens sometimes,I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong ,2175
2176,devastated,I probably wouldve cried,The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to,2176
2177,prepared,Was it like black friday? lol,I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!,2177
2178,prepared,Stick to your routine next time,YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was  usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no  not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!,2178
2179,prepared,I hear ya! I am definitely shopping online,I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year  I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!  ,2179
2180,prepared,plus you can usually get some kind of cash back. I love deals,Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!,2180
2181,surprised,Ew  I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage.,The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider ,2181
2182,surprised,Oh no  throw it away!!!!,I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that! ,2182
2183,apprehensive,How was it too much?,"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater  but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.",2183
2184,apprehensive,That sounds very strange,"Well  to their credit  they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK  but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!",2184
2185,anticipating,How big is the bonus usually?,Around this time of the year  my husband usually always gets a large bonus  but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!,2185
2186,anticipating,Wow  well I hope you guys get it this year then!,It all depends  but always has been thousands. So  the waiting drives us nuts!,2186
2187,trusting,Why did you do that?,When my friend told me to give him my last $400  I thought he was crazy. But in the end  I am glad I did.,2187
2188,trusting,Wow  good for you guys!,He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!,2188
2189,embarrassed,How old were you?,Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.,2189
2190,embarrassed,That is young  I wish someone had helped you!,I was about 16 at the time. The thing is  I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!,2190
2191,grateful,Math has never been my strong suit. I'm more of a history type of person.,I don't know how you are with Calc  but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.,2191
2192,grateful,That was very altruistic of her! ,Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!,2192
2193,annoyed,Why she is doing that?,My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night ,2193
2194,annoyed,Ah ok I undestand.,She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her! ,2194
2195,excited,why did you go back?,I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27  I would have thought you were crazy.,2195
2196,excited,good for you  best of luck!!,I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer  but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra  and was accepted to a state university two years ago! ,2196
2197,devastated,Oh no. Did you have a good backup plan ?,i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college,2197
2198,devastated,Maybe you can transfer after a bit ?,yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha,2198
2199,jealous,How did that make you feel?,My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...,2199
2200,jealous,I understand! I would feel the same way.,Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her. ,2200
2201,impressed,What do you mean by that? I'm not a gamer really,i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years,2201
2202,impressed,Oh you're right  it has. I hear about it more and more,gaming has blown up this past couple of years ,2202
2203,anticipating,I hate that most parks close during the winter too. Do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?,I love roller coasters  but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter. ,2203
2204,anticipating,I feel you. You will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!,Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around  all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.,2204
2205,hopeful,Ooh  congratulations! I'll be graduating soon too. What's your major?,I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.,2205
2206,hopeful,That's very cool. My dad's an electrical engineer  actually. I'm a cybersecurity major myself.,I'm an Engineering major  electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?,2206
2207,grateful,What is your most prized posession?,i really am thankful for everything that i have and had,2207
2208,grateful,Why is that?,it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little,2208
2209,impressed,Oh wow  maybe he can get a scholarship! I know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs.,My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!,2209
2210,impressed,You must be very proud of him! Yes  I love to bowl with my family but I'm not very good at it!,Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?,2210
2211,afraid,That is scary. Do you have means of defending yourself?\,I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.,2211
2212,afraid,Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Don't hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!,No I don't  I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!,2212
2213,embarrassed,Ha ha! I have done that  too. So embarrassing.,So I suck hard at bowling  but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.,2213
2214,embarrassed,Phew  so they got most of the attention.,Yeah  my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.,2214
2215,ashamed,It can be hard in those situation I know you don't want to loose a friend in the end.,I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend  for various reasons  but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!,2215
2216,ashamed,Yes you should but when you feel comfortable don't feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this.,Yes  and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus  I really hated to hurt her  but I guess I should have told her.,2216
2217,lonely,Aw  that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?,I still live and work in the place where I grew up  but all of my friends have moved away.,2217
2218,lonely,How awful! You're much better off staying at home. I hope you find new friends soon!,No  everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night  so I keep to myself at home  alone.,2218
2219,afraid,School can be tough. How many credits are you taking on?,So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.,2219
2220,afraid,Engineering is already tough. If you can get through this  I'd say you'll be very successful in life.,I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.,2220
2221,confident,oh you're gonna be awesome i bet!,So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!,2221
2222,confident,yeah that always happens  don't be hard on yourself as long you do great,Thanks  I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.,2222
2223,content,Nice. What was dinner?,So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.,2223
2224,content,I haven't met a pizza I didn't like yet.,Surprisingly enough  a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!,2224
2225,sad,I remember my kids going through that. Do you have teething rings for him?,my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru,2225
2226,sad,Poor boy. I hope he gets through it soon.,I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad,2226
2227,anticipating,What is the game about you must love games it will take up your whole night.,I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.,2227
2228,anticipating,Really that is a cool story to tell when asked how you 2 met did ya'll play online together a lot?,World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.,2228
2229,annoyed,Oh that's not good. Do they argue about small things?,I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.,2229
2230,annoyed,Yikes  that shouldn't be. I think you've really stepped up in this situation. Hopefully they can see that and change their ways.,Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.,2230
2231,terrified,I love storms too but yeah  that's a nuisance.,I think storms are wonderful  except when the power goes out.,2231
2232,terrified,Yikes! Lightning didn't strike real close by  did it?,It was extra loud and my husband was at work  bit scary.,2232
2233,hopeful,That is good. Will it be a difficult semester?,College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!,2233
2234,hopeful,That is good. I am sometime a procrastinator.,It probably will be  as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!,2234
2235,nostalgic,Awww  what fun.  That must have been so nostalgic for you!  I wish I was back in childhood again sometimes.,I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.,2235
2236,nostalgic,I saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when I was a kid and wow  it was so neat to see!,It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories  things were often simpler and more carefree back then.,2236
2237,surprised,Wow. Sibling's got skills.,So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere  he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.,2237
2238,surprised,How long has he been bowling?,For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!,2238
2239,apprehensive,I am sorry to hear that  I am sure you will be fine. What kind of job is it?,I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.,2239
2240,apprehensive,Well  it shouldn't be too bad. If you couldn't do the work I'm sure they wouldn't have hired you.,it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.,2240
2241,guilty,That's a bummer. At least you will be more attentive next time?,So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.,2241
2242,guilty,Indeed. If everyone got worked up over things like that  we'd all be out of jobs.,For sure  that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose  can't expect to be perfect!,2242
2243,lonely,That sounds incredible. Did you visit the Great Salt Lake?,So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.,2243
2244,lonely,Man  I definitely have to go there. Sounds like a great place for sightseeing.,No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself  would do again!,2244
2245,jealous,Oh my god  Do you think he got it just because you like it so much?,So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!,2245
2246,jealous,That is hilarious  In a cruel kind of way.,I don't think so actually  I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!,2246
2247,apprehensive,Ohh  I feel you. I felt the same way  when I was planning to buy a new car.,So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.,2247
2248,apprehensive,Yeah. I believe you are emotionally attached to it!,Yep. Like  my current car is dying  but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.,2248
2249,angry,Wow why would they even do that?,PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!,2249
2250,angry,Sheesh  people will take anything that's not nailed down these days.,It was during a power outage during a hurricane   still made me mad.,2250
2251,annoyed,That's terrible to hear. Is it old?,So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!,2251
2252,annoyed,Are you thinking of getting a new car?,Oh yes  very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now  I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.,2252
2253,anxious,Me too. Its nerve wrecking,I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.,2253
2254,anxious,Maybe you should take some classes to help you with that,I know! Like  mentally  I don't care  but my body just responds by making my legs shake  my heart pound  and speaking too quickly.,2254
2255,disgusted,Ohh  cleaning dog poop is always been annoying  yet petting the dog is always amusing.,I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times  it was awful.,2255
2256,disgusted,Ha ha. I feel sorry for you though. No one likes to clean the dog poop!,Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them  but I would be lying.,2256
2257,embarrassed,That has happened to me several times,So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.,2257
2258,embarrassed,Lol. They probably just laughed about it over dinner,Yeah  not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.,2258
2259,grateful,Were you able to get them?,I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester. ,2259
2260,grateful,That was so sweet of him! You're lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend,Yes  everything's taken care of  thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!,2260

2264,surprised,Well thats good. Probaby saved a bunch of coins,yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well,2264
2265,sad,I would also cry with you!,i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad,2265
2266,sad,I cry at least a day!,yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now,2266
2267,angry,oof that sucks really bad,i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants,2267
2268,angry,yea i can imagine it is,yeah  i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off  it is really embarrasing,2268
2269,devastated,That sucks  are you going to leave Texas or stay?,When katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings,2269
2270,devastated,How much did the damage cost you?,Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well,2270

2274,hopeful,Good for you.,Yes. I was expecting that very much.,2274
2275,apprehensive,Were you afraid of heights and high speeds?,My kids and I went to Six Flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but I had so many reservations about getting on it.,2275
2276,apprehensive,I am glad you did. Rollercoasters are thrilling and should not be missed out on!,The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!,2276
2277,surprised,oh wow! that sounds very special!!!,When I turned 40 last year  my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.,2277
2278,surprised,im glad your family did that for you,It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.,2278
2279,terrified,Oh wow! That must have been terrifying! Were they able to help her?,A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!,2279
2280,terrified,I could imagine. It must have been amazing to see her rescued though!,Yes  someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.,2280
2281,disappointed,That sucks. Did they give you any reason why they won't verify it?,So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.,2281
2282,disappointed,Well  I hope they can get you taken care of soon. I know I hate it when I can't get to my money I have online.,Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.,2282
2283,annoyed,I am the same.. woke up at 6 for no reason,Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in  yet here I am awake early.,2283
2284,annoyed,LOL i hate that,It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.,2284
2285,terrified,What happened?,I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.,2285
2286,terrified,I understand those kind of situation could scarry.,I don't know  it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.,2286

2316,grateful,Oh no! That's awful!  I watch animals for a few different people and I would never do that.  That's very unprofessional. Did they have an emergency?,I was going to a wedding outside of my city  and had arranged to have my dogs watched while I was gone  but the person backed out really soon before I had to leave.,2316

2324,sad,I'm so sorry.  I know you must've felt helpless but coming from a wife's perspective; I would know my husband couldn't be right next to me but his words and love make all the difference. ,My wife is out of the country for school  and the other day she was having a really bad day.  I couldn't really do anything to help  and it made me feel bad.,2324
2325,sad,I totally feel you.  My husband as gone for work so much for a couple years.  It will just be a season of life and then you'll be back together!  Communicating even more than ever and encouraging each other can help so much.  You're doing great!  I hope you're together soon!,Thanks  that's actually really helpful.

2338,sad,I'm so sorry!  That can be a devastating time. I have been there before.  How long did you have your dog?,I was sad when my dog died,2338
2339,sad,I completely understand.  Something that helped me was to have pictures up and also have a little remembrance each year with some other family that loved him as much as I did.  Just take it a day at a time.,I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world,2339

2349,guilty,Well then I dont blame you. I would have done the same thing,i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late,2349

2371,excited,Congratulations! I hope everything goes well! ,To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.,2371
2372,ashamed,Oh  wow. Its like that sometimes. You have to give into your sweet tooth.,The other night I was just craving candy. I ate up all that we had! ,2372
2373,ashamed,Ugh  I hate the regret that comes with giving into food cravings. Don't be too hard on yourself. It was just one time.,Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning! ,2373

2380,angry,i bet  have you told them how u feel about it?,My parents always argue and it pisses me off!,2380
2381,angry,i guess just walk away is all,I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?,2381
2382,angry,Well you can get better,Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine  I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.,2382
2383,angry,You will do better next time  I promise,I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there  and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved  and I would be answering phones.,2383
2384,excited,I do not have those,That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?,2384
2385,excited,I do not attend school,So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?,2385
2386,devastated,I am sorry to hear that  I hope you had some time together before hand,My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.,2386
2387,devastated,That is good at least  you had some closure at the worst,I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But  you always wish you had more time. But  the last words I said to him was that I loved him  and I'm grateful for that.,2387
2388,embarrassed,What happened?,Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen,2388
2389,embarrassed,What did you win?,we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny],2389
2390,ashamed,Oh that sucks.  Those are the types of situations where you can't help it  but you know you did wrong the second after it's over.,My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper  yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.,2390
2391,ashamed,Well  there aren't any rules against apologizing to your kids?,Yes  I was already not in a good mood  and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But  I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes  I felt very bad.,2391
2392,caring,Yeah you can judge someone like that,You never know what someone else is going through  and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.,2392
2393,caring,Thats a nice gesture from you,It was hard to tell honestly  but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home  so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.,2393
2394,excited,Oh man  the beach always sounds nice,We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!,2394
2395,excited,That sounds like it was lovely,It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time  and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!,2395
2396,embarrassed,I am sure not many people noticed,The last time I went to the fair  I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls  that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!,2396
2397,embarrassed,I can imagine  sorry,Oh no  there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now  but not at that moment.,2397
2398,sad,I am so sorry I have been there so many times,I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.,2398
2399,sad,I am sorry you had to go through that,it's never going to be ok  but it will be a little less painful in time.,2399
2400,embarrassed,What did they do,It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.,2400
2401,embarrassed,Oh well  he will learn,Took a small toy  put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.,2401
2402,guilty,You do what you want  you earn it!,As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.,2402
2403,guilty,Why?,Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day,2403
2404,angry,Why is he not helping?,I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much  its fustrating!,2404

2410,sentimental,What of?,We had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage. I found an old box of pictures!,2410
2411,sentimental,Oh  that is awesome  I love those trips down the old memory lane,My family and all kinds of old memories  birthdays  festivals  swimming  and other stuff,2411
2412,annoyed,Oh wow  talk about bad timing,It's so hot and our AC just broke. We had to open the windows to be able to sleep! ,2412
2413,annoyed,Oh no  I hate flies,The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you,2413

2442,sentimental,I'm so sorry for your loss.,We recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent. It made me think of the last vacation I was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away.,2442
2443,sentimental,He sounds like a great guy. I'm glad you have fond memories of him.,Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away  it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.,2443
2444,jealous,She may be skinny  but it doesn't mean she's healthy.,my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am  eating healthy  working out and still loking fat,2444
2445,jealous,Yea  I totally understand that. She won the genetic lottery there.,that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her,2445
2446,disappointed,Have you tried speaking with the post office?,It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it  somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it,2446
2447,disappointed,That's ridiculous  they should have to do something.,i did  the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number. ,2447
2448,disgusted,That sounds like fun. what did it bring to you?,My cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me.,2448
2449,disgusted,Eww... that's pretty gross. I had a cat once that would bring me dead birds too. I think that means they like you!,Well  it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse,2449

2455,disgusted,Oh god  roaches. Did you guys use the bathroom anyway?,Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.,2455
2456,grateful,Are you okay?,It sounds crazy to say  but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle  it could have been much worse.,2456
2457,grateful,oh my gosh  a plate! That kinda sounds serious.,I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!,2457
2458,proud,that is a lot.. most i ever took at one time was 5 classes and i cried at least twice that semester.,Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering  and I took 6 courses.,2458
2459,proud,Damn that is impressive congrats.. I took 1 class last semester and got an A lol,Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though  it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!,2459
2460,anticipating,That's true. Did you finish the job?,Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.,2460
2461,anticipating,That's really great. It's nice when everything works out in the end.,I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.,2461
2462,embarrassed,Oh  all the time. I've got to change my Depens three times a day.,Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?,2462
2463,embarrassed,Oh wow. I just would've blamed it on whoever I was with.,Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me  it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant  and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!,2463
2464,lonely,Oh  I don't know why concerts make me feel a bit sentimental,I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun  but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.,2464
2465,lonely,That must have been horrible! I'm so sorry you went thru that,I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day  but we had to stay in the same room.,2465
2466,content,Yes  some people call it fate.,You know how sometimes things don't go as planned  but it feels like they turn out better in the end?,2466
2467,content,That sounds so romantic!,You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event  but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.,2467
2468,devastated,Oh no  was it benign?,My father was having abdominal pain  so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.,2468
2469,devastated,That is so terrible  I'm so sorry.,It was cancerous  but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly  with no exact cause of death.,2469
2470,nostalgic,Do you dress up when the new movies come out also?,I love it when the new star wars movies come out  seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back! ,2470
2471,nostalgic,Ah  I bet seeing all of the kids now dressed up does take you back to an earlier time.  Nostalgia has a way of getting to each of us.,I don't anymore  but when I was a kid  a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I. ,2471
2472,confident,what is a dive bar,On our second date  my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.,2472
2473,confident,oh ok. We call them hole in the walls lol,Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks  sometimes a little dirty  but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.,2473
2474,confident,mine too.,Yeah  I should have just said that. Honestly though  my favorite places to drink.,2474
2475,sentimental,are you going to pass it down too?,My father passed away a few years ago  but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.,2475
2476,sentimental,well thats nice,I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.,2476
2477,faithful,Oh yeah that can be a mine field to walk across. Didn't have any issues?,Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.,2477
2478,faithful,That's very faithful of you  and the right thing to do I'd say. ,Actually  an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me  but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.,2478
2479,afraid,Did a specific experience cause this? or just instinct.,going near hights really makes me scared,2479
2480,afraid,Thats interesting my mother has always been afraid of heights  Not myself though.,just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights ,2480
2481,afraid,I use to go to raves when I was in high school.,During carnival season  there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.,2481
2482,afraid,Did you get arrested?,They are a lot of fun! I must admit though  I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.,2482
2483,sentimental,Why did she break up with you?,my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago,2483
2484,sentimental,Are you still friends with her?,we where just not getting along  and did not h ave enough time to see each other,2484
2485,apprehensive,Me too! the first one I ever went to traumatized me.,I was always terrified of haunted houses when I was little.,2485
2486,apprehensive,That seems like a weird birthday activity.,Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go ,2486
2487,angry,Have you ever woke her up and told her to stop?,My sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying,2487
2488,angry,Thats hilarious  my mother snores like a monster,well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah,2488
2489,joyful,Yes! thats actually amazing  you have a good friend!,My friend and I spotted a mini-gold course when we were coming back from the next state over.,2489
2490,joyful,You are lucky! who won?,I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!,2490
2491,excited,Yay! is it a family member having a baby,I feel excited about our upcoming baby shower,2491

2495,sad,did you do anything special during your alone time?,when she left for 3 weeks i was alone,2495
2496,sad,that is not good  you should try to find an activity for when you are alone,nothing at all. I was kinda depressed,2496
2497,prepared,tHat is insane  I usually give myself like 2 or 3 days.,My Calculus final was no joke! I started studying hard two weeks before the test.,2497
2498,prepared,Thats right! thats such a good feeling  just breezing through a test.,Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test  I was absolutely solid on the material.,2498
2499,lonely,Where did she go?,Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks,2499
2500,lonely,Oh  I bet that was frustrating. Did you get evey thing squared away and taken care of?,To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.,2500
2501,content,Where are you living at?,I am happy with where we are now living,2501
2502,content,That sounds amazing,A very nice complex with 3 pools!,2502
2503,hopeful,That's great to hear. What made you think it went well?,I interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well.,2503
2504,hopeful,Those are good signs! Sounds like you hit it out of the park!,The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.,2504
2505,impressed,Pool's always a difficult game to pick up. I'm guessing your first time went well?,Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine  she had to beat the guy running the table.,2505
2506,impressed,Wow. Talking about cleaning up.,I shot so-so  but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.,2506
2507,jealous,Are you still going to attend it?,I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.,2507

2578,joyful,I know how you feel. My oldest is in her sophomore year of college. ,It's kind of a surreal feeling tho  hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.,2578
2579,angry,did you talk to them politely or yell back ?,So a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I hate when people do that!,2579

But  my sister had passed away around 6 years before  by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.,2661
2662,guilty,What did you do to feel that way?,I feel like a terrible sibling right now. ,2662
2663,guilty,I'm sorry to hear that  you could make it up to them by going to visit?,My sister  who lives out of state and i don't see often  was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.,2663

2673,hopeful,Did you win? LOL,I bought a ticket last week for the lottery  when it was over 100 million dollars.,2673
2674,hopeful,Winning those huge jackpots is always a curse.  Go for a smaller win :),I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn  but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.,2674
2675,surprised,That is so exciting. A little extra cash can always help.,My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news,2675
2676,surprised,Yes  that would be a great surprise. It can also take a lot of stress off of you.,It sure does. It came as a shock  but a pleasant one. ,2676
2677,proud,how was it,I just went today to visit my son in his new house.,2677
2678,proud,thats cool,It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it. ,2678
2679,furious,You should make a wheel you can spin to decide.  I did that once.,So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!,2679
2680,furious,Yes you put all the places on it and spin..,That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.,2680
2681,furious,Put that on there too!,Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.,2681
2682,joyful,Oh me too! Do you have a monday to Friday type job?,I'm so happy that it is Friday!,2682
2683,joyful,Oh that is a pretty good schedule. I am a teacher so I'm off right now. It's wonderful. ,Somewhat  I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?,2683
2684,trusting,Maybe its time for a new friend.,feels disappointed because my friend fights with me,2684
2685,trusting,ask him to stop being a jerk?,no i can't because i love him a lot,2685
2686,anxious,Oh dear  that must be difficult. Are there medications to take that will help?,I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.,2686
2687,anxious,Oh  I'm really sorry. That is for sure a challenge. ,yes  but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun,2687
2688,terrified,I'm glad you were safe. Tornados are not a fun thing to experience.,Some time ago  there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes  a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it  or harm my familY!,2688
2689,terrified,Have you only had to deal with one?,No  they are so awful! They can destroy so much.,2689
2690,surprised,Well  that's very nice. I'm sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip.,My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently,2690
2691,surprised,That's was so thoughtful and sweet! Seems like you are a lucky wife!,I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.,2691
2692,nostalgic,That is a lot of fun.  What is your favorite holiday to drive around in?,I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.,2692
2693,nostalgic,Im sorry it makes you miss your moms decor.  At least you have those memories to hang onto.,Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.,2693
2694,grateful,That must be comforting!  It is good to have people in your life that are supportive.,I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her,2694
2695,grateful,Don't ever take her for granted!  Make sure she knows you are thankful!,I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.,2695
2696,disappointed,Oh  I'm sorry to hear that. Do you not live close to a beach?,A few weeks ago  we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But  it rained several days  so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted  which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.,2696
2697,disappointed,That must suck not living close to a beach. Hopefully you get to go back real soon.,Oh  no  it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So  a long time since we first went.,2697
2698,proud,Hah  seems we both had some luck. Good for him!,My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting,2698
2699,proud,You guys should go out and celebrate! ,I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.,2699
2700,trusting,Lucky! I would not trust anyone in my house!,We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man  so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.,2700
2701,trusting,I am happy for you! ,We didn't have much choice  as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat  so if we didn't  we'd come back to not having pets. But  I wouldn't just let anybody  that's for sure!,2701
2702,angry,Oh no! That's my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets,My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell,2702
2703,angry,Aw  perhaps she just slipped up? It does happen even to the best of us,I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things,2703
2704,terrified,Oh that can be scary. I don't watch horror movies because I know that I'll do just that!,One night when my children and I came home  I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!,2704
2705,terrified,Well I'm glad you were ok! Sometimes it's not just a shadow,It was so scary! Luckily  it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up  but it first appeared to be an intruder!,2705
2706,content,That's the best kind of day.,Last weekend  my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together  and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home  just enjoying each other's company.,2706
2707,content,Must have been so nice  what movie did you watch?,Yes  it was drama free and a relaxing time.,2707
2708,sad,I am so sorry to hear about Riley  I know he was an important part of the family. How is everyone holding up after the news?,My dog  riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure,2708
2709,sad,Yes that is true. You know there is peace in another place. He will always be remembered.,It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps,2709
2710,guilty,I can empathize with you there.  Do you think there might be another way to let her know? ,I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support  and that's why I didn't tell her. But  I still felt so bad about it.,2710
2711,guilty,Well money is not everything  one day it will come out and then the timing will likely be worse.,Well  she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job  plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.,2711
2712,afraid,Really!  Good for you!  Are you excited to start or nervous?,I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.  ,2712
2713,afraid,It's OK to be nervous  but don't let it stop you!  No risk  no reward!,I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take,2713
2714,annoyed,That sucks  I work with people like that and it's just more work for other people,There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments  so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating  since it causes others more work.,2714
2715,annoyed,That's horrible  you should tell the boss and get her fired,Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over  but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!,2715
2716,sad,I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with  especially for a child.,My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning  and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.,2716
2717,sad,I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything! ,Yes  she was only about 9  and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!,2717
2718,surprised,You are lucky!,I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.,2718
2719,surprised,how much did you win?,Not normally  so I was quite surprised. ,2719
2720,surprised,I have never won that much. Congratulations,$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.,2720
2721,furious,Oh no! What happened?,I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day. ,2721
2722,furious,Oh geez  thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.  I was in a hit and run about 4 months after I bought my new car and I felt sick that it was already hit.,Someone backed into my new car.,2722
2723,jealous,Wow. Do think he had bad intentions?,Many years ago  we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her  but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!,2723
2724,jealous,I understand.,Well  she was attractive and at the time  I thought he was thinking that too. But  I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place  since she was falling down. But  it was hard to see it at that time lol,2724
2725,furious,Oh man...I hate checking the mail..it could be something crappy,I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.,2725
2726,furious,Oh god- Do you live in the country?,Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night. ,2726
2727,furious,Then the person might be caught  do you have a camera? That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this,Not really. I live in town  but it's a small town.,2727
2728,furious,It's a good idea to have one just in case. Murders  robberies etc happen even in small/nice towns. Just for your safety ,That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.,2728
2729,sad,That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?,My aunt came to visit today  we went out for mexican food!,2729
2730,sad,That is a shame.  At least she made a stopover!,Yes  kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours  she is on a road trip!,2730
2731,prepared,What's the exam on?,I have a big exam for college coming up  I have been studying day and night.,2731

2733,nostalgic,That's really cool! Was it your first game ever?,I went and saw a hockey game today  It was really exciting.,2733
2734,nostalgic,Well I think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!,No  I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool. ,2734
2735,caring,That's so interesting because I saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today.  Is that you? ha ha.,I was on a run today  and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!,2735
2736,caring,Ha ha  guess you weren't the one.  That would've been crazy!  I hope its okay!  I'm sure someone will try to grab it.,Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!,2736
2737,sad,oh my goodness thats terrible  i am so sorry!,I got some bad news today  my dad passed away.,2737
2738,sad,i can imagine! my dad is my best friend i would be devasted,Thank you  I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.,2738

2745,guilty,you can do it!,Thanks! Being on a diet is hard  espically with family in town!,2745
2746,afraid,That's really creepy.,I was running today and felt like this car was following me..,2746
2747,afraid,Also some kind of sound alert. You think you could scream for help during those times  but a lot of people actually don't.,Yes it was  I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something,2747
2748,sentimental,is that a good show? i have never heard of it,Im watching the show The Bold Type  my favourtie characters dad died :(,2748

2756,annoyed,I'm not a fan of doctors most of the time - how did it go?,I had a doctors appointment today.,2756
2757,annoyed,I cannot stand that - they should not schedule people so close together if they can't handle that pace.,I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back. ,2757
2758,caring,Aww - did you feed the cat?,I had just moved in to my new apartment  and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.,2758

2765,excited,That's awesome! Now that I have kids  I have even more of an excuse to go out and check out what creative ideas people have every year.,It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor  and everyone agreed it was terrifying!,2765
2766,devastated,Oh no!  I can't even imagine that - was everyone ok?,Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire. ,2766
2767,devastated,I'm so glad that everyone was ok.  But I know that was devastating - did you rebuild?,Yes  thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened. ,2767
2768,grateful,scary! how long were you lost for?,When me and my friend got lost in the desert  I thought we were done for.,2768

2796,angry,Did you get mad at her?,One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!,2796
2797,angry,Hopefully she won't do it again.,Yes  she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her  and it was her work! I let her know it too.,2797

2802,grateful,You must of been hard working.,My husband and I are at a point in our lives  we are able to save  afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can  as I know many aren't able to do that.,2802
2803,grateful,That is great news. Congrats.,Yes  we have been working hard  as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But  it's worth having some financial freedom!,2803

2855,annoyed,Oh well  it happens though  don't be too hard on people!,I do  everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them  like cups or papers.,2855

2864,jealous,We're all human so having a feeling like that is understandable.,I know it's silly  but my friend got something I wanted in a game the other day  bit sad.,2864
2865,jealous,Yea  I'm always surprised at how much I sweat the little things.,I guess  little things at times right?,2865

2876,lonely,i feel for you. it really makes life tough when you can't just take a drive down the road and see them.,My family is over 2 000 miles away in Alaska  its tough!,2876
2877,caring,That's horrible. Did he get to go to the dentist yet?,My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache,2877
2878,caring,That's very kind of you to be there for him like that. ,Not yet  but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.,2878
2879,devastated,Oh no that's awful. I am sorry for your loss!,Ah  it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.,2879

2894,trusting,i believe so too   if people are gonna cheat why get married at all,I know  I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.,2894
2895,afraid,That's awful  but better safe than sorry. How were things when you came back?,Ten years ago now  a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.,2895
2896,afraid,That's a silver lining in all of it at least! ,Pretty messed up  but the house was still standing.,2896
2897,angry,That's terrible. I thought they had to offer some sort of alternative. What airline was it?,was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative,2897
2898,angry,I've never trusted British Airways. ,British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting  they could not,2898
2899,excited,You are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor. Was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?,I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course  taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.,2899
2900,excited,Sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience.,Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was  but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful  it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special! ,2900
2901,nostalgic,Do you have any kids?,I like going fishing  it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.,2901
2902,nostalgic,I have 3- I bet you can't wait to take him fishing.,I do  I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?,2902

2904,embarrassed,OH wow! Did you get it all over youself?,No  it was at work.,2904
2905,grateful,That sounds like a really stressful situation. It's really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!,I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it! ,2905
2906,grateful,I'm glad you've put a positive spin on it :) ,Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!,2906
2907,anticipating,Who do you support? ,I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!,2907
2908,anticipating,Cool. Do you play football too?,Auburn Tigers,2908
2909,embarrassed,Oh no! What did you do?,I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.,2909
2910,embarrassed,Oh yikes! That's a bummer. I'm sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time  though.,I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.,2910
2911,proud,Oh that's super excited! I'm sure you're really proud of him.,I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.,2911
2912,proud,That's super great to hear! Well deserved.,Oh yeah  definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!,2912
2913,trusting,What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day.,I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint  he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!,2913
2914,trusting,Are you goings going to stay friends?,It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier. ,2914
2915,angry,Did you get hurt?,I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.,2915
2916,angry,I hope you get better soon!,Yes  I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!,2916
2917,hopeful,That's never fun!  Large unexpected expenses are the worst,My transmission in my car went out the other day  maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.,2917
2918,hopeful,Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to  the new house!,Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too  so my money is tied up.,2918
2919,angry,Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?,I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.,2919
2920,angry,That is just awful. Now you'll have to pay to have it repaired. ,No  I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.,2920
2921,prepared,Nice. Did you like it?,Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!,2921
2922,prepared,That is nice.,I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary ,2922
2923,impressed,It was who who were them?,Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech  and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!,2923
2924,impressed,Ok thats amusing,I'm sorry if I was unclear  I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).,2924
2925,proud,Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!,So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!,2925
2926,proud,I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! ,Yes  very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.,2926
2927,disgusted,Oh no! Were you gone for long?,So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!,2927
2928,disgusted,What a bad doggie... hopefully they don't do it again,We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess,2928
2929,hopeful,I can hear the sigh of relief in your voice. I bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be. ,I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start,2929
2930,hopeful,I can tell your proud of yourself. Im happy for you!,yes very. but I know that it will be good. ,2930
2931,hopeful,You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it,Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress,2931
2932,hopeful,I agree  but having great joy in life helps,I try to be. it can be difficult on some days  but I think I have a good attitude towards most things,2932
2933,hopeful,It's good you're motivated! That's a step in the right direction,I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.,2933
2934,hopeful,I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention,Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.,2934
2935,jealous,That's amazing and a very quick profit!  I'm a little bit jealous myself.  ,My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck,2935
2936,jealous,It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small  like the company headquarters opening  can effect an entire town like that,Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!,2936
2937,surprised,Yikes.  Did you get injured?,So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.,2937
2938,surprised,Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  That's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.,No  but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.,2938
2939,jealous,I would be too! That's a really nice car for his first car!,My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.,2939
2940,jealous,I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!,No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!,2940
2941,excited,Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car,I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!,2941
2942,excited,HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best,I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.,2942
2943,nostalgic,Nice! What genre of playlist was it? ,I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.,2943
2944,nostalgic,Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.,It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado  2pac  etc.,2944
2945,anxious,I can only imagine! How is he now?,My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.,2945
2946,anxious,Doctor's are good at what they do! I hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!,They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.,2946
2947,anticipating,That is great news!  I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.,I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud  inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!,2947
2948,anticipating,It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own,I just can't wait! I've seen the new place  and it backs onto a forest  so there'll be peace there  at least!,2948
2949,guilty,oh   how he reacted next,I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!,2949
2950,guilty,its ok it happens with every one,It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.,2950
2951,anticipating,Yes  that will be awesome! How long has it been since you've seen everyone?,We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone  especially my brother and sister.,2951
2952,anticipating,That's fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.,It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.,2952
2953,proud,That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.,I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.,2953
2954,proud,It's really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.,Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it  but consistency does seem to pay off.,2954
2955,hopeful,That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?,I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.,2955
2956,hopeful,You can do it! Don't forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!,I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though  I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future,2956
2957,impressed,Sounds impressive  does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?,My brother got a custom-made bowling ball  and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.,2957
2958,impressed,Very nice  I would be proud too.,He's on his high school bowling team  but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.,2958
2959,ashamed,oh no what happened?,Ok  so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!,2959
2960,ashamed,that would really help if it was a permanent solution,Well  they were shouting and stomping around  so I lost it! This morning  they've been quiet as church mice  so I guess it worked :),2960
2961,ashamed,yeah enough is enough. i totally can't say i blame you.,Yeah  I really do feel bad  but it's been going on for over a year.,2961
2962,ashamed,bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.,Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up  lol.,2962
2963,afraid,I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.,I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.,2963
2964,afraid,That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.,No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.,2964
2965,anticipating,That will be an amazing trip!!,I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!,2965
2966,anticipating,That will be so great for them - I can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time - what a sweet time you are about to have.,I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him,2966
2967,nostalgic,Christmas was always a nightmare for me.,I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.,2967
2968,nostalgic,I cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.,I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.,2968
2969,confident,That is great! It's so awesome to feel confident after an interview!,The last time I went into a job interview  I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.,2969
2970,confident,Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?,Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.,2970
2971,terrified,Was it a ghost?,Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!,2971
2972,terrified,Oh that was so hillarious,I wasn't sure at first and  being in a wheelchair  had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep  walking her dog!,2972
2973,proud,That's great  keep it up if you can!,I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself,2973
2974,proud,It's good that you're being more proactive about your health now.,I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese,2974
2975,impressed,Man  i wish i could get one.,My co-worker just bought a brand new car. ,2975
2976,impressed,I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.,I know  me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.,2976
2977,afraid,Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that. ,i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are,2977
2978,afraid,It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.,I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone,2978
2979,excited,Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!,I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!,2979
2980,excited,OH that will be such a huge relief I'm sure!  It's crazy that people behave that way  knowing they are causing other people such strife.,Not with traffic  but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there  so fingers crossed!,2980
2981,furious,Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?,Someone stole my identity.,2981
2982,furious,That is horrible! What will you do?,I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.,2982
2983,grateful,That is truly all you can ask for.,i have food on my table  a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful,2983
2984,grateful,I try to never take anything in life for granted. ,yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted,2984
2985,surprised,Wow  impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more? ,so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets,2985
2986,surprised,You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.,thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies,2986
2987,joyful,I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?,I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!,2987
2988,joyful,I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! I'm glad you were able to visit him!,Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.,2988
2989,grateful,Aww. It's the things money can't buy that bring us the greatest joy  no?,When I spend time with my family  it reminds me how lucky I really am.,2989
2990,grateful,That is so true and it's a good perspective to have.,Definitely. Even when times get rough  there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that  but glad I do now.,2990
2991,grateful,Dogs really are such great companions  what breed is she?,My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much,2991
2992,grateful,Yes I have a miniature pinscher  he just turned 15.,She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?,2992
2993,anxious,how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start,School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!,2993
2994,anxious,the summer is horrid. heat  sweat  mosquitos  rain  and crowds everywhere,Oh yes  I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?,2994
2995,ashamed,I do the same! I think everyone does.,I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it,2995
2996,ashamed,I think it's a normal human activity. You don't need to feel bad,yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad,2996
2997,prepared,That's the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!,I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.,2997
2998,prepared,Always put your school first  you will be thankful you did later!,I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.,2998
2999,caring,Whoa that's exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?,My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.,2999
3000,caring,That's a really good/safe first car.,Probably some kind of SUV  maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!,3000
3001,proud,Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want,I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!,3001
3002,proud,Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!,I want an SUV  like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!,3002
3003,afraid,That's annoying  I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road.,Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off,3003
3004,afraid,I'm glad that you are okay! Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.,I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary,3004
3005,sentimental,I can imagine. How old will they be?,My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.,3005
3006,sentimental,Yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done. ,She will be 30. It makes me feel so old  but also how fun it was when they were little.,3006
3007,confident,Now that you what? Tell me!,I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I,3007
3008,confident,Oh that is great! I've heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!,Sorry  I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!,3008
3009,content,That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?,I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.,3009
3010,content,Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?,Yes  it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans  which are delicious!,3010
3011,content,I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live  but this is new to me. ,They're the same shape as regular green beans  but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.,3011
3012,content,It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?,What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange  different things to try!,3012
3013,surprised,How did he scare you?,I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!,3013
3014,surprised,I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!,Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!,3014
3015,disgusted,Oh that sounds disgusting! ,My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.,3015
3016,disgusted,I hope he gets that taken care of!,Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.,3016
3017,devastated,I think we never really know what is going on inside people's mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life  but in reality  they are suffering.,When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life  I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people  yet was miserable in his own life.,3017
3018,devastated,I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.,It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!,3018
3019,devastated,All around  it would be a good decision for society. Just last night  I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed  he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.,Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.,3019
3020,nostalgic,Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?,I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away,3020
3021,nostalgic,How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.,Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!,3021
3022,surprised,Wow! That is insane  too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.,I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel  I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!,3022
3023,surprised,That sounds like a great time  one of those nights you always remember!,Yeah  for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do  if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!,3023
3024,surprised,Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.,I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.,3024
3025,surprised,Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!,That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.,3025
3026,prepared,I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.,When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.,3026
3027,prepared,"Yes  you are correct. You can always ""hope"" for the best  but also ""plan"" for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling.",It feels good to get everything together  doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!,3027
3028,proud,That's wonderful  they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages.,i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please,3028
3029,proud,Wow! That's impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.,he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian,3029
3030,content,Did you think about moving after that?,A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.,3030
3031,content,haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?,Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time  lol.,3031
3032,surprised,Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!,I found a cat in my attic yesterday!,3032
3033,surprised,Oh no. That sounds really stressful!,My husband is allergic to cats to  I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!,3033
3034,proud,That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.,My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back  just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed  she pulled herself together and made a new  exciting life her new reality.,3034
3035,proud,Wow  I wish more would follow her example. That's a recovery.,Yes  she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there  she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!,3035
3036,impressed,I haven't watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?,I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!,3036
3037,impressed,That's real neat  I might check it out. I've only ever used Netflix  but Netflix is pretty good too.,I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!,3037
3038,sentimental,Aw  I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!,My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident  I'm so upset.,3038
3039,sentimental,Aw  that's always sad  I lost a cat once and I assume that's what happened to her ;(,Yes  we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.,3039
3040,sentimental,That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?,I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.,3040
3041,sentimental,That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.,Yes  I heard about it. Such a sad story.,3041
3042,surprised,That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.,My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..,3042
3043,surprised,You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!,I did! It was a very nice gesture.,3043
3044,hopeful,Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?,We are waiting on military orders right now  I'm so hoping they come through next week.,3044
3045,hopeful,Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.,Yes  we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.,3045
3046,disappointed,I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days  I just don't understand how they could do that.,I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.,3046
3047,disappointed,I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that  for instance more jail time.,Right  these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.,3047
3048,sentimental,i had a similar experience  i miss it too,For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree  helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course  eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.,3048
3049,sentimental,i totally agree,It's nice to think back  tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now  but the good old days will always remain just that!,3049
3050,surprised,I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out  it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely  it wastes a lot of money.,Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.,3050
3051,surprised,A week!?  That is just crazy  and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire.,Yes  exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries. ,3051
3052,excited,Where to?,We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.,3052
3053,excited,I spent some time there  when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!,Texas  there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change. ,3053
3054,prepared,It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't overprepare.,I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.,3054
3055,prepared,I am glad you didn't get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.,So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.,3055
3056,surprised,I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!,My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her  one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!,3056
3057,surprised,You are very lucky!,Oh yes  and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!,3057
3058,apprehensive,That's strange  I hope she makes it out ok this time though.,My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards ,3058
3059,apprehensive,Oh wow  I would never consider something like that hurting a dog.,She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess,3059
3060,sad,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.,Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us,3060
3061,sad,I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.,Yes  it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult  so it was really hard when she passed.,3061
3062,prepared,That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?,We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.,3062
3063,prepared,Well  it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.,I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.,3063
3064,prepared,That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?,I've been so busy packing  packing and more packing. ,3064
3065,prepared,That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you won't have to leave everything boxed up for too long.,Yes  don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.,3065
3066,content,That is great! You are lucky!,I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.,3066
3067,content,It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.,I do feel very lucky  especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.,3067
3068,nostalgic,Nice! Which ones did you hear!,I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.,3068
3069,nostalgic,That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!,Mambo #5  Missy Elliot  and Ricky Martin. It really took me back,3069
3070,anticipating,How did you do?,I took a test for college the other day  it was basically our midterm.,3070
3071,anticipating,Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?,I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.,3071
3072,excited,That is great! Can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?,I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!,3072
3073,excited,Well yeah  that sounds about right. He has to go to the Championship first and win  then party time !!!!!,He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to  lol!,3073
3074,excited,It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!,You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!,3074
3075,confident,That's sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?,I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.,3075
3076,confident,I am in VA. I have been looking into it for quite awhile  but I think I'd be too chicken to jump out of the plane.,There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.,3076
3077,prepared,Nothing wrong with that. I'm definitely with you on the organizational front. I bet they're not laughing when you get them out of a jam!,Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life,3077
3078,prepared,It drives me nuts when people are disorganized. My husband is hopeless - I could throttle him sometimes!,"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared""",3078
3079,disappointed,Oh man that is really annoying!  Have you found another one you like yet?,You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(,3079
3080,disappointed,Oh man I would be so upset.  I totally understand!  I hope you will be able to enjoy your new place,Yes  but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!,3080
3081,devastated,Oh no! Do you know why?,my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out,3081
3082,devastated,Aw  I'm sorry. I hope you get another horse that can at least help to replace that hole!,yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad,3082
3083,anticipating,Do you know he is coming  or is it just blind luck?,i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here,3083
3084,anticipating,That is very considerate of you  I bet he really appreciates that.,i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives,3084
3085,proud,Wow. That is quite an accomplishment! Congratulations!,i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate,3085
3086,proud,What was is your doctorate in?,yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end,3086
3087,excited,what has she been doing? undercover CIA agent?,My wife has been out of the country for 2 months  and is getting back in a week.  I'm super pumped!,3087
3088,excited,*wink* *wink* ,No  taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P,3088
3089,anticipating,Ha  yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise there's going to be a price to pay.,My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P,3089
3090,anticipating,It always is  plus it gives you some brownie points as well.,Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad  but it's nice to come home to a clean house.,3090
3091,embarrassed,I am sorry to hear that  my wife has done the same thing. She wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house.,i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public,3091
3092,embarrassed,Well  like I told her  it will grow out  it will just take time.,yeah it is the worst  i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing ,3092
3093,disappointed,That doesn't sound good. What happened that was so bad?,I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often  so it was a bummer.,3093
3094,disappointed,That sounds like an awful experience. I probably wouldn't go back there anytime soon.,The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.,3094
3095,embarrassed,Oh lord. Did you try to set it back up  or did you try to sneak away?,I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.,3095
3096,embarrassed,Oh no  that's really embarrassing! Hopefully they let you off easy since it was just an accident.,It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.,3096
3097,excited,I know you're happy 😊,My wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week.,3097
3098,excited,I feel ya  lonely indeed.,Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :),3098
3099,lonely,That sucks. Why did you move from california?,I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.,3099
3100,lonely,That's really common actually. There's a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.,My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway  a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly  huh?!,3100
3101,lonely,The weather is nice in parts of california  I've been there.,The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.,3101
3102,lonely,My sister got married at Laguna niguel,The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?,3102
3103,confident,That is a long trip.  Did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?,A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip  but I knew I could do it just fine.,3103
3104,confident,That's not bad  I was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days.,It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East  so kind of knew what I was doing.,3104
3105,caring,Oh  poor lady. I do hope she's feeling better. What was wrong with her  if you don't mind my asking?,My wife was really sick the other day  she was stuck in bed for most of the day.,3105
3106,caring,Well  I'm really glad to hear she's recovered. Stomach bugs are awful - they really take their toll on you.,Not completely sure  maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now  though her appetite took a bit to come back.,3106
3107,content,Why was it boring  nothing exciting to do where you live?,summer was so boring for me  im really happy school is starting again,3107
3108,content,Ah yeah  that sucks. No time for anything fun.,not really  i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did,3108
3109,afraid,What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery. But typically surgeries like that are very safe  but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about.,My mom is having weight loss surgery next week  I'm nervous.,3109
3110,afraid,Well  everyone is entitled to their own life choices. I'm sure she'll be alright.,She is having gastric bypass surgery  I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!,3110
3111,angry,Yeah  that's never fun. Did you lose at something recently?,there is nothing i hate more than losing in something,3111
3112,angry,I agree  it makes you just want to try harder next time.,not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me,3112
3113,joyful,That's great  what specifically has made it so good for you?,It has been a wonderful Monday!,3113
3114,joyful,Wow that all sounds very exciting  congratulations!,I found out a got a pay raise at my job  we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!,3114
3115,sad,thats so sad oh no! thats terrible. :( ,I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(,3115
3116,sad,They are honestly just like children so its really sad. ,I know  it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.,3116
3117,lonely,Awww  I totally know that feeling. I hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along. She is family!,my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone',3117
3118,lonely,I can imagine! Is he doing okay?,yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back,3118
3119,sad,It must have been! Have you guys been apart before?,My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer  dropping her off at the airport was really tough.,3119
3120,sad,Ah so you've gone through it a couple of months alrready. How much longer is she going to be away for?,Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months  but it's almost over!,3120
3121,grateful,You must be so thankful!,When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school  we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.,3121
3122,grateful,They are really wonderful. Do you have plans to show how thankful you are?,We are.  They've helped a lot during my life  but this might have been the biggest one.,3122
3123,sentimental,When will you be going ?,i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo,3123
3124,sentimental,Wow  I hope you have a really nice trip.,in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years,3124
3125,terrified,just cause of the way they look or you had an incident involving one?,i cant get near spiders  even if i see them in pictures they freak me out,3125
3126,terrified,yea im right there with you on that one along with snakes heh,not really i was just born afraid of them hahah,3126
3127,surprised,That sounds like a pleasant surprise! ,A few years ago  before we got married  my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing.,3127
3128,surprised,Thats so sweet of her and what a great memory to have! ,It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.,3128
3129,annoyed,That's a terrible waste of food  how old is your little brother?,i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e,3129
3130,annoyed,Well  I hope he soon sees that is not something that he should be doing.,he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying,3130
3131,angry,That's brutal  did she get out?,I was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car.,3131
3132,angry,Did she have insurance?,Yeah  we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something  she was really off.,3132
3133,disgusted,Awful! did you complaint?,i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant,3133
3134,disgusted,Food should be made hygiene. We shouldn't compromise on health.,yeah i did  they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again,3134
3135,angry,That's annoying  was it garlic bread?,I had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and I found out my husband ate all the bread! ,3135
3136,angry,What did you say to him after he did it?,It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup! ,3136
3137,surprised,How so?,i feels surprised,3137
3138,surprised,That's awesome!  I love getting surprises!  ,my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly ,3138
3139,sad,That's so sad.  I've lost dogs before.  I know how you feel :(,My neighbor used to have an old beagle - a lovely pooch. He died of cancer just before Thanksgiving. I looked for him for weeks - I miss him.,3139
3140,sad,Yeah dogs are man's best friend.,Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.,3140
3141,sad,Yes I've got one.  She's a stray that showed up to work one day.,They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?,3141
3142,sad,She's been a great dog. I've got no complaints or regrets.,That's wonderful  that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.,3142
3143,trusting,Oh wow haha that's not good,I'm not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!,3143
3144,trusting,That's an interesting combination  maybe you should try to keep him out of the kitchen,He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night! ,3144
3145,impressed,What grade is he in?,My son came home today and was working on his homework.,3145
3146,impressed,Awesome! That had to be a great confidence boost for him! ,In 7th and they're doing pre algebra. He said he didn't know it  then proceeded to get every question right!,3146
3147,prepared,That's amazing! How long have you been running?,I've been training hard for a marathon next week  and I am beating my record time!,3147
3148,prepared,That's pretty cool. I hope you win!,For a few months now  but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.,3148
3149,anxious,"I'm right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted  but since coming to college  I've been forced to socialize more  and it's help me at least ""fake it until I make it."" I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time  but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?",I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious,3149
3150,anxious,I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better  most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down  too. Good luck,that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice. ,3150
3151,apprehensive,That sounds awesome. Have you ever been before?,I recently went to ruby falls  an underground cavern with a waterfall. ,3151
3152,apprehensive,I wish I could go sometime that sounds like quite the experience.,Not that particular one  no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.,3152
3153,apprehensive,How'd it turn out? Congrats on deciding to lead a healthier life  by the way.,I had some hesitations when I was at the gym today  thought I wouldn't be able to handle the weights,3153
3154,apprehensive,I'm the exact same way in the gym. Music is a huge motivator for me. One time my phone died while in the gym and the rest of the workout was so low energy.,I decided to focus on the music that was blasting  just tried switching up what I play in the gym  it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle,3154
3155,terrified,Yeah I have  it wasn't serious but I got rearended,Have you ever been in a car crash before?,3155
3156,terrified,That's terrifying  I'm so glad you're okay,I got T-boned once  I'll never forget spinning around in that car  hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.,3156
3157,caring,That is very sad. Did something recently happen to her? ,My wife has been really sad here recently  I've had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night.,3157
3158,caring,That is absolutely horrible. I hope she has a moment of happiness very soon. No one should have to deal with that much loss. ,Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals  and the most recent one was really hard on her.,3158
3159,surprised,Death by a thousand cuts  I call it! They'll try to make a buck off anything!,"My bank  which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?",3159
3160,surprised,Did you try talking to them about it? I can only assume it wouldn't go well but you never know.,Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.,3160
3161,devastated,Yes  I have.  One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?,Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.,3161
3162,devastated,I am soo soo very sorry.  Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen.  I pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings.,Yes  my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.,3162
3163,annoyed,Yeah  I have. Do you?,Have you ever had a new puppy?,3163
3164,annoyed,It happens. Hope your dog will poop outside soon.,Yeah  he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside  but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!,3164
3165,disappointed,Always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown.,I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there,3165
3166,disappointed,Oh wow! I HATE when you get the urge to eat something and then you get to the fridge only to realize it's gone. Do you know who ate it?,Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone! ,3166
3167,guilty,Thats horrible! You should tell them as that is their property. What if someone did that to your stuff?,I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.,3167
3168,guilty,GOOD on you!!,I agree  I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it  I went out and confessed.,3168
3169,anxious,I know how you feel  financial problems are rough. I know you'll figure out a way to make it.,i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month,3169
3170,anxious,That really stinks! Don't worry too much though  things will work out.,thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive,3170
3171,sentimental,That's awesome  what was in it?,My mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago. I recently dug it out and went through it.,3171
3172,sentimental,You must be happy to have it back  those are the best memories.,Photos from my whole life growing up  with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.,3172
3173,afraid,Ugh! I hate it when stuff like that happens. Were you able to get a refund on your tickets?,I once was taking a big trip I had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going.,3173
3174,afraid,Awesome!!,No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents. ,3174
3175,afraid,That is very true! Was it bad weather?,Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.,3175
3176,disappointed,i hate that too  what were you going to do?,I hate it when plans fall through. I really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend.,3176
3177,disappointed,Maybe I could come with you  I'm near Florida.,I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute  the two people I was going with backed out  and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.,3177
3178,impressed,Why don't you believe him? He made have been quite the big name back in his day.,My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day  but I never believed him. ,3178
3179,impressed,Wow  that sounds amazing. I wish I could have seen that!,I don't know if he was famous  but the other day  he got on stage  bit the head off of a bat  then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!,3179
3180,disgusted,That sounds interesting.  What kinds?,I used to do flooring work  we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes. ,3180
3181,disgusted,Oh that's awful!,well  one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.,3181
3182,annoyed,Is that like the child equivalent of under the bed?,It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box,3182
3183,annoyed,That's kinda strange. I assume that's something he'll grow out of.  How old is he?,I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it  it still happens,3183
3184,content,Wow  that took some guts! What made you want to cut it?,I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.,3184
3185,content,And just think about how much you're saving on shampoo and conditioner!,It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut  but it looks much thicker and healthier now.,3185
3186,embarrassed,Ahhhh! I've done that before  but I noticed it quick.  Did you not know til the end of the day?,I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants  right on my bottom.,3186
3187,embarrassed,That's embarrassing  ah  I'm sorry.  Just play it off tomorrow at work! ,Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it. ,3187
3188,disappointed,Please tell me it was not full of Oriental Trading Company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.,I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.,3188
3189,disappointed,"Oh man! I feel bad for laughing but ""literal garbage"" is pretty funny. That sucks  can you report them to eBay?",I would've happily taken that! Instead  it was filled with literal garbage  like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.,3189
3190,confident,How did you do?,I had my final exam for Chemistry today!,3190
3191,confident,That's good. I was never good at chemistry,I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.,3191
3192,lonely,I understand  anything you need to talk about?,It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone,3192
3193,lonely,Buck up little camper.,You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you,3193
3194,proud,How is she doing,I've been training a new girl at work this week!,3194
3195,proud,I am happy for you and her,She's doing great  especially for her second week on the job!,3195

3198,jealous,well the casino won! did you at least get some free drinks?,I was just at the casino  spent almost 100 dollars on a single machine. I didn't will anything.,3198
3199,jealous,hah.. at least you had fun it sounds like,Haha  yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up  someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.,3199
3200,terrified,I do hate when the lights are off too,I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off,3200

3202,anticipating,I am happy for you. Are you excited?,I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.,3202
3203,anticipating,I bet you will be fine. Just be yourself,Yeah  I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.,3203
3204,anxious,Are you ready for it?,Tomorrow is the big day  I have to deliver my proposal to the client.,3204
3205,anxious,I am sure you will do well,I have been preparing for weeks  but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.,3205

3207,annoyed,What is his name?,I love him  too  a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop  even when he's been fed.,3207
3208,proud,Oh that's great! Congratulations on your upcoming finish!,I'm finally almost done with my associate's degree! I technically started wayyyy back in 2011  but I just got serious in 2016.,3208

3210,ashamed,Ohh what happened?,Playing hookey can be really fun. But sometimes it backfires...,3210
3211,ashamed,Sometimes things like these happens. Don't worry. But playing hookey is a fun though,When I was a teenager  I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!,3211
3212,lonely,I know exactly what you mean.  It gets so lonely on the road.  Have you had to go away recently?,Sometimes I enjoy being alone  but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.,3212
3213,lonely,That's still quite a long ride.  Do you do a lot of long distance biking? ,This was a while back  but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally  he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.,3213
3214,guilty,on to the next one  as they say!,I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.,3214
3215,guilty,have the new chick there when she comes home,I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.,3215
3216,terrified,Oh yeah.  I've never seen it  I can't watch horror films.  How did you like it?,I just watched the ring movie for the first time.,3216
3217,terrified,Ohhh boy.  I hope you have a person or an animal to snuggle up to to help you feel better.,I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.,3217
3218,afraid,That's scary when that happens,Once I took a sip of iced tea while I was driving and it went down the wrong pipe. I had to pull over so I could try to breathe again.,3218
3219,afraid,Some people DO die from choking  be safe!,Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol,3219
3220,guilty,Why is that?,My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.,3220
3221,guilty,Oh that makes sense  well be careful,Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.,3221
3222,terrified,Whoa  that is scary! Did you know him?,A man came to my door with a gun  asking for money.,3222
3223,terrified,I am glad that you are okay!,I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me,3223
3224,sentimental,Hahaha  sounds kind of like clickbait,"I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like ""1 easy step""",3224
3225,sentimental,Hahahaha  that's so funny,Exactly  I started taping my mouth closed at night  finally woke up before noon  mission accomplished,3225
3226,joyful,That is weird but amazing! Does it work?  If it does  I will get my husband to tape his mouth shut.  He snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back I guess.  Is that true for you?,I started taping my mouth closed before bed  and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up  feels like I am born again,3226
3227,joyful,Do you have any advice on what kind of tape?,Yeah  it,3227
3228,surprised,That sounds like a nice time!,Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.,3228
3229,surprised,Wow that worked out perfectly,It was  but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived  there was a festival with games  performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!,3229
3230,annoyed,Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?,I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud  and I had a hard time focusing,3230
3231,annoyed,Well  I hope you have some really good earphones - or that they quiet down - it's a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud.,No  I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible,3231
3232,angry,I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads. It was so distracting trying to talk to them.,I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!,3232
3233,angry,Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots. I can't believe the cost-cutting measures in place today!,That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card  and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!,3233
3234,sentimental,wow  thats nostalgic!!. It must have brought back lot of good memories,I went to a bar I used to go to in college  and I was surprised to see an arcade machine I built with a dear friend of mine!,3234
3235,sentimental,does the machine is in good condition now?,Yes  playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have.,3235
3236,apprehensive,What happened?,I hadn't been to the dentist in five years but made an appointment recently because of a toothache,3236
3237,apprehensive,Are they going to pull the tooth?,I just started to feel a sharp pain in one of my teeth. It might be a cavity or something worse,3237
3238,disappointed,Thats not strange at all,I can't believe I am telling you this  but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.,3238
3239,disappointed,That sucks. What did you do?,I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is  when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!,3239
3240,caring,Oh no  the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?,My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving  she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.,3240
3241,caring,You're a terrific partner. You guys can do something outdoors next time  right?,Unfortunately  it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead  I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.,3241
3242,surprised,hahaha why was it underwhelming?,My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking  but ultimately underwhelming thing,3242
3243,surprised,lol how do you feel about spiders?,I guess because furry things don't really scare me  I was like well that was a waste of a reaction,3243
3244,angry,Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?,I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift,3244
3245,angry,I see   I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation,No not really  just seeing how much energy I could summon from within,3245
3246,anxious,You are good at generalizing aren't you?,There's too many things to think about,3246
3247,anxious,I have no clue.. really I don't!,Yeah  what am I getting myself into,3247
3248,excited,how much did you win?,I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.,3248
3249,excited,Thats sounds like a fun trip or 8,Close to $20 000  I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.,3249
3250,joyful,that sounds cool.,I went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way. It actually took place at a pool.,3250
3251,joyful,Wow. I would love to see something like that,"It was an adaptation of ""The Last Unicorn"". It had parts that took place in the water  and parts that took place on a giant trapeze!",3251
3252,joyful,What did you name her?,I got a new puppy. She's really cute and playful,3252
3253,joyful,Thats so cute!,I named her Layla.,3253
3254,nostalgic,Oh you must have enjoyed it!!,I recently went to a Steely Dan concert with my lady.,3254
3255,nostalgic,Yeah indeed it must have been then,Yeah  it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.,3255
3256,caring,So cute! What kind of dog is it?,I just got a new puppy  names fido.,3256
3257,caring,That's amazing  I wish I could get a puppy too  but my cat is not friendly,It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it  definitely needs a lot of attention,3257
3258,angry,That's crazy did you ever get it back?,On my way to work  a goose stole the toupee I needed to impress the new secretary  Christy.,3258
3259,angry,I am so sorry maybe you will have better luck next time.,No! I am so furious with that goose  that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.,3259
3260,disgusted,Eww  it may be time to call someone to take care of them.,I was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher.,3260
3261,disgusted,Oh  that had to be super gross! ,I almost fell over trying to crush it  i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.,3261
3262,afraid,How creepy!,I was walking down the street at night  I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.,3262
3263,afraid,At least nothing happened to yo,Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....,3263
3264,anxious,That's rough. Did you end up getting the job?,I had a job interview that I didn't really feel prepared for.,3264
3265,anxious,Well  there's always next time. At least you can chalk it up as a learning experience.,I did not get it unfortunately. ,3265
3266,disgusted,That's strange. What did you discover under there?,One time  I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.,3266
3267,disgusted,Oh my! That is repulsive indeed! I would've taken it home for dinner. Waste not want not!,Well  when I went to lift the engine cover  I noticed a dead  rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.,3267
3268,surprised,Oh NO!  Are you okay?,I went to the store  just trying to get some milk and bread  and I got rear ended by a driver.,3268
3269,surprised,Yeah I bet!  Did they stop and check on you?,Yeah  it was more of a shock than anything  was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.,3269
3270,prepared,"Oh yeah? Is it on par with ""I Have a Dream""?",I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.,3270
3271,prepared,Woah now! I wasn't thinking of a speech on that grand of a scale! I hope you blow Gimli's beard clean off his face and make 20 horns of Gondor sound!,I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.,3271
3272,grateful,wow that was really nice of them,Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.,3272
3273,grateful,Most people now a days won't do that. Make sure to pay it forward!,Yeah  I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.,3273
3274,surprised,That's great  man! Did you study hard for it?,I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.,3274
3275,surprised,Well  that's all that matters! Just gotta pass those exams!,I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.,3275
3276,sentimental,Aw  that's awesome  did it bring back memories?,I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.,3276
3277,sentimental,Yeah  it's always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days.,It was pretty nostalgic   how young we all looked growing up.,3277
3278,joyful,Nice! Who did you go see? Did you catch a homerun?,I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.,3278
3279,joyful,That sounds amazing. All I have is my lowly Senators sea level stadium...I am mad jealous.,It was the Rockies  no home-run though  it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.,3279
3280,disgusted,Oh dang. Was she a hoarder? What did you find?,When my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother's house who had recently passed  I was not prepared for what we found.,3280
3281,disgusted,I can't even imagine the stench...did you make out with any buried treasure?,You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady  and the mix of paper  bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.,3281
3282,angry,Oh that's terrible.  Is he alright?,I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.,3282
3283,angry,That really stinks that that happens.  Are you pretty upset about it?,Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.,3283
3284,impressed,I do love a smooth ride. What kind of car is it?,When I bought my new car  I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was.,3284
3285,impressed,That's awesome! I am mad jealous that you have my dream car!,It's a Chevrolet Camaro.,3285
3286,excited,Wow  you were dedicated  did you do well on it?,I studied for 7 months to take the GRE exam  it was stressful.,3286
3287,excited,Congratulations  all the hard work paid off!,I did  and I was accepted to my number 1 program  which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!,3287
3288,prepared,That must of been pretty stressful. But did you get enough sleep?,I studied all night for my final exams. I needed to pass them to graduate from college.,3288
3289,prepared,Sleep is just as important as studying hard. You can kill your performance without it.,I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.,3289
3290,terrified,That's terrible! Did you get it back with everything still inside?,I left my wallet in a movie theater  and didn't notice till I was half way home!,3290
3291,terrified,At least you have a happy ending for that story.,I was able to get back in and find it  it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.,3291
3292,grateful,I agree. I think I am one of them  considering I gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday.,Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.,3292
3293,grateful,That's really great  but I swear it was true! It was a whole 50 cents. Looking back on it  I am kinda sad I did it because now I can't buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket. Hopefully some orphan uses it wisely.,That's incredible if true  but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!,3293
3294,sentimental,That's good to hear  what did she do to make you proud?,I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.,3294
3295,sentimental,Oh wow! That's amazing  i'm sure that was a really touching moment!,She performed her first solo dance in competition  but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.,3295
3296,disappointed,Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit.,I'm grateful for the work hours  but bummed that I can't get time off.,3296
3297,disappointed,Wow  that is a long time! That shows how dedicated you are to your job  and that you deserve some time off!,Well  I've worked without a break for the last 3 years  I just want to get away abit.,3297
3298,hopeful,That is awesome.  What are you hoping to do?,I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far  and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!,3298
3299,hopeful,That's the dream  to get paid in college.  I wish I could have done that.  Congratulations!,I am an electrical engineering student  and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year  I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!,3299
3300,furious,Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick-up?,I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.,3300
3301,furious,That is insane! I've never heard of anything like that before.  You all should start protesting!,The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents  so the dump has a line every day.,3301
3302,disgusted,Oh really? What was it they served?,'s all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.,3302
3303,disgusted,Oh wow... I really can't imagine eating it knowing it had those in it.,"I should have known better  as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!",3303
3304,hopeful,I hope she hears some good news. Is it pretty serious?,my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.,3304
3305,hopeful,I'll be praying for her  I hope she continues to stay in the clear in the future.,She had stage 3 cancer  but she was clear last screening a year ago.,3305
3306,faithful,Oh no  it's awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot.,I went to a wedding recently  and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy  but at least he knows he can trust me.,3306
3307,faithful,Yikes. Well  at least you did the right thing by passing that long  as painful as it might have been. ,Yeah  his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up  and let him know what had happened.,3307
3308,annoyed,am sorry about that  what are others doing about it,I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills,3308
3309,annoyed,sorry  just tryy to be patient with them,Not much. It's all on me. It sucks,3309
3310,nostalgic,Old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me. That is why i try to avoid them as they evoke many emotions in me,I love playing old school video games. The music is amazing,3310
3311,nostalgic,It is just that I miss my friends a lot with whom i used to play. I wish i could just rewind time and go back,For me it's happy emotions,3311
3312,excited,I love beer! I wish I could try your guy's beer.  Is it a hard process?,The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I  as we love craft beer. Until recently  our town didn't have one though.,3312
3313,excited,Awesome  that's great news!  Hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!,We actually don't brew our own  and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!,3313
3314,jealous,ooh  you should not be  she should be appreciated for looking good,I hate it when other guys look at my girl,3314
3315,jealous,aha  thats funny though,She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!,3315
3316,sad,Oh  I haven't read it  but I was also sad to hear he passed,"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential""  or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.",3316
3317,sad,Yes  too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldn't seek help,He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food  and we all still look up to him.,3317
3318,surprised,Aw  that's so nice of them! Was it fun?,My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.,3318
3319,surprised,That's great! It's so nice that you have people around you who care,Yes  it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard. It meant a lot that they did it for me.,3319
3320,caring,Ohhh..I would love that experience! How special!,I gave twin fawns in our yard some fresh peaches and they loved them.,3320
3321,caring,I love that too! I try feeding everyone :) Awesome!,I enjoy helping the wildlife in our area. It is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand.,3321
3322,excited,Oh geez! Why was she gone for so long?,In a week my wife will finally be back from being out of the country for 2 months!,3322
3323,excited,That's pretty cool! That would be hard though! Were you all able to talk a lot?,She was taking a language course in Germany for her graduate studies.,3323
3324,surprised,How long have you been there ?,I'm moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor I was leaving. He said he was sorry I'm going!,3324
3325,surprised,Sometimes we affect people that we don't realize.,About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.,3325
3326,annoyed,That doesn't seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?,Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday  so I had to work overtime  but I didn't even get paid for it!,3326
3327,annoyed,It sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees.,I'm technically salaried  so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating. ,3327
3328,angry,Wow  did you ever get them in trouble?,I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it,3328
3329,angry,There you go  take victories where you can get them!,Sadly  no.  There's no actual proof of who it was  but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once  so I'll take that as a victory.,3329
3330,hopeful,Great  what is his field ?,My husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!,3330
3331,hopeful,I see. I hope for all the best for you and him.,He is currently Active Duty Army  but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics. ,3331

3333,content,Thats awesome! What kind of soup do you make?,Yes I am  about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!,3333
3334,anxious,My brother just graduated and is on the job hunt  and he's described his experience as the same thing.. Seems like he has good interviews and they're receptive to him  but they don't really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Can't imagine how frustrating it is,When I applied for the job I have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer.  It was pretty stressful.,3334
3335,anxious,Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope it's been good so far.,Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end  but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.,3335
3336,jealous,That sounds like so much fun!,A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.,3336
3337,jealous,I totally get why you feel that way.  Your time will come soon.,I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France  Italy  Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!,3337
3338,jealous,I hope you can recover soon!,I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.,3338
3339,anticipating,That's good! I bet you missed her a lot.,My wife has been out of the country for 2 months  she gets back in a week.  I can't wait!,3339
3340,anticipating,I'm sure she'll have a lot to tell you about her trip!,I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :),3340
3341,anxious,That's a long time to kind of hang in limbo. I am sorry you had to endure that for a month.,When I interviewed for the job I have now  they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.,3341
3342,anxious,Well  at least that story had a happy ending. It could have went much worse.,It worked out ok  but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.,3342
3343,lonely,Aw  I bet you miss her a lot.,My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.,3343
3344,lonely,Well  at least the dogs still have you for company. I'm sure you'll be happy when she gets back though.,I do.  She's getting back soon  but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.,3344
3345,hopeful,What kind of job is it?,When I interviewed for my current job  I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.,3345
3346,hopeful,Interesting! What kind of things do you do?,A lab technician at a university.,3346
3347,jealous,aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you,My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.,3347
3348,jealous,well after a certain age parent's start to treat children differently lol,"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair.",3348
3349,sad,when does she return?,My wife has been out of the country for two months  which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.,3349
3350,sad,well thats good,She gets back in a week  so it's almost over.,3350
3351,disgusted,Did you go running like crazy!? ,my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty,3351
3352,disgusted,i would have done the same glad no one got stung! ,heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work,3352
3353,annoyed,They are bad now too  they are so annoying,i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season,3353
3354,annoyed,It can be irritating to deal with this time of year,yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them,3354
3355,terrified,Come on  the worst that can happen is that it kills you.,Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders  but she made me kill a huge one yesterday. ,3355
3356,terrified,It's certainly a good enough reason to kill them.,Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!,3356
3357,excited,Wow  are you nervous at all,I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!,3357
3358,excited,That's exciting. I'd never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.,A little bit  but I love doing extreme stuff like this.,3358
3359,disgusted,That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well  at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!,The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night! ,3359
3360,disgusted,I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me  that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot  so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!,It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs! ,3360
3361,anxious,Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results. How do you feel about it? ,On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.,3361
3362,anxious,I understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital! ,Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.,3362
3363,grateful,That's a good friend you got there.,I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack ,3363
3364,grateful,Never take someone like that for granted. They are so rare.,she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her,3364
3365,embarrassed,What types of situations are you referring to?,Cell phones are great  but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.,3365
3366,embarrassed,lol  did everyone around you make funny faces?,Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline  and it was not an appropriate topic!,3366
3367,sentimental,I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?,My dog died today :(,3367
3368,sentimental,It's hard to lose a family member like that. You guys should take some time to grieve.,Yes  she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.,3368
3369,lonely,Where did they go?,my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely,3369
3370,lonely,That sounds like so much fun!,they went to the beach for 1 week,3370
3371,excited,That's great!  I've got to deal with loud neighbors too.  Anything specific they do?,I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!,3371
3372,excited,Loud running toddler who pitches fits at random times  day or night.  Sounds like a similar level of noise :P,Stomp around at all times of the day and night  screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?,3372
3373,joyful,Oh wow  I bet you can't wait! I remember when I had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband.,My wife has been out of the country for two months  and is coming back in a week!,3373
3374,joyful,Well  she'll be back soon and you'll have loads of catching up to do. I bet the dogs missed her too!,It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer  I've gotten super bored :P,3374
3375,disgusted,Could you elaborate as to why?,I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!,3375
3376,disgusted,Oh no could you call an exterminator?,I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!,3376
3377,confident,I'm sure you'll do great!  How long have you been training?,i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game,3377
3378,confident,Wow  that's a lot of dedication!  I believe in you!,for this specific game for about 3 months,3378
3379,sad,i can imagine  i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself,After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.,3379
3380,sad,yeah it always gets bbbetter that is the good thing,It's gotten better now  but it could still get even better.  Just got to keep on moving.,3380
3381,excited,That sounds like fun! I've always wanted to visit India.,i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india,3381
3382,excited,Nice. I hope you have a great time!,yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years,3382
3383,content,That sounds like a relief.,I had the most wonderful week recently. My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!,3383
3384,content,It seems like it's a lot of ruckus  I've visited friends who have your situation and I can only imagine. ,It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.,3384
3385,content,Glad you enjoyed that short period of peace. Maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.,That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!,3385
3386,content,Oh  good. I'm sure it will be an improvement from your current situation.,Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.,3386
3387,embarrassed,Omg i would have been so embarrassed! :O ,I went to work with my pants inside out  and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.,3387
3388,embarrassed,thats true imagine if you had! it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them. ha ha ,It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.,3388
3389,afraid,that is awesome  i hope that happens to me on my next trip  where where you going,The airport was completely empty the other day.,3389
3390,afraid,well you are really lucky to have an empty airport,Home  but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am  it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.,3390
3391,nostalgic,I would go mad  were you away at college or in the service?,i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him,3391
3392,nostalgic,That is great  I am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you. He will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door.,college  but i will be seeing him very soon i think,3392

3394,proud,Yeah  he'll be all grown up before you know it!,I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.  IT goes by to fast!,3394
3395,excited,Did it turn out how you expected it,A few months ago we were planning our wedding and I couldn't wait until the actual day finally arrived.,3395
3396,excited,I'm glad to hear... Weddings can be stressful,It was even better then expected. It was very small  but so happy how it turned out.,3396
3397,angry,Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?,i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing  i dont care if he poops if she picks it up,3397
3398,angry,Its the only way to get them to learn,hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea,3398
3399,proud,That's wonderful  it's always good when hard work pays off like that!,After studying and preaching for a few years  my husband was ordained to be a minister.,3399
3400,proud,I bet so that sounds nice,Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.,3400
3401,annoyed,Oh wow  that sounds like it was a big mess.,This morning  my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.,3401
3402,annoyed,I hope she didn't eat too much of it  it might make her sick.,Yes  and to make it worse  when I tried to clean it  she tried to eat  so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.,3402
3403,disappointed,Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?,There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it ,3403
3404,disappointed,That's a shame. I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.,I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive  small  and bland! ,3404
3405,faithful,That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations,In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.,3405
3406,faithful,If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.,If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument  but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.,3406
3407,impressed,He must be really strong!,My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once! ,3407
3408,impressed,Sure   I strong men is very attractive! You must be proud of him!,He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too! ,3408
3409,sentimental,That is hard thing to go through. I hope you are feeling better about it now.,i was really sad when my dog died last year,3409
3410,sentimental,I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.,yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about,3410
3411,disappointed,Aw  that sucks. But at least he got a job  right?,A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer  but he got a job and had to cancel.,3411
3412,disappointed,Well  hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you.,Yeah  and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him  but would have really liked to see him.,3412
3413,devastated,Oh my. That is very unfortunate.,My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday  we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe  have fun  and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call  we found out that she had a heart attack and died.  ,3413
3414,devastated,I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.,Yes  it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013  and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.,3414
3415,sad,That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats  is because they're so independent  and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.,My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her. ,3415
3416,sad,Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.,I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad,3416
3417,hopeful,My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport  albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming  and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.,I love to play golf  but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.,3417
3418,hopeful,Well  often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself  at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens  motivation starts to become real easy to get.,It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you  too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!,3418
3419,trusting,I've never been skydiving myself. I hear that it's a great experience  but I'm not sure if I have the bravery for it.,Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!,3419
3420,trusting,Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?,I did not for many years  but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.,3420
3421,impressed,Sounds like fund  you must be excited!,I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!,3421
3422,impressed,I think I will need to do that  my TV is an oldy.  I am sure you will have a great time.,I am  I have been watching all my favorite movies. ,3422
3423,terrified,That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.,I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face! ,3423
3424,terrified,How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.,I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled! ,3424
3425,anxious,Well  it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?,I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything,3425
3426,anxious,I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck,a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job  they pay really good money,3426
3427,nostalgic,Did you tell anyone about the dream?,I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.,3427
3428,nostalgic,You should call your best friend on the telephone!,I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.,3428
3429,nostalgic,That is sure to make you feel the nostalgic?,I actually sent her a message through facebook.,3429
3430,surprised,oh that sounds like fun,I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.,3430
3431,surprised,sounds like a wonderful day!,Yeah  he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day. ,3431
3432,disappointed,Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway. ,I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved  it was sold out everywhere  except Ebay. The problem was  the price was doubled.,3432
3433,disappointed,Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon. ,I may buy it still  but I have to save up more money now.,3433
3434,guilty,It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.,I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!,3434
3435,guilty,Well you have to live a little every now and then. I'm sure it was worth it  haha.,It was sheer greed  I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments  but I really shouldn't have done that.,3435
3436,caring,Oh no  poor baby,my son is sick  he got this hand foot and mouth desease  nothing serious but he has a fever,3436
3437,caring,Yes cuddles will help,i know  i got some motrin  funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow,3437
3438,nostalgic,That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?,i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions,3438
3439,nostalgic,Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.,honestly  no  it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again,3439
3440,excited,I'm fascinated by how people can watch golf  I always found it really boring  but if you enjoy it then great!,I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.,3440
3441,excited,Oh that totally changes things I guess  makes sense.,I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that  if you don't play  it would be pretty boring!,3441
3442,furious,Aw that's terrible  at least you were able to comfort her?,Last Christmas Eve  after a family event  I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him  and it had hurt her feelings.,3442
3443,furious,I'm sure you were! Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.,Yes  I was able to make her feel better  and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out  and I was ready to confront some people.,3443
3444,disgusted,Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?,I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it! ,3444
3445,disgusted,LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.,I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden! ,3445
3446,disgusted,Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. ,I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!,3446
3447,disgusted,Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people. ,They're filthy  ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison  without parole!!!,3447
3448,afraid,Oh  I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?,Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I. ,3448
3449,afraid,I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.,It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in. ,3449
3450,trusting,You do? thats good  friends can be terrible people to lend too.,My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.,3450
3451,trusting,I bet he pays you in full.,They can  but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan  so I reckon I'll be ok there.,3451
3452,trusting,I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?,My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first ,3452
3453,trusting,Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. ,He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too! ,3453
3454,terrified,Does it look like a space ship?,Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first  especially if it's in the early morning  like 3am or something.,3454
3455,terrified,I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time,Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it  and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?,3455
3456,annoyed,What does she do?,i love my friend  she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes,3456
3457,annoyed,Wow  I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying,like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat,3457
3458,sad,Aw I understand that  I have gone through that myself and it's very hard. When did this happen? ,It is so difficult to have a pet pass away  I really miss him.,3458
3459,sad,Oh no I'm very sorry. What kind of pet? ,Over the summer  he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.,3459
3460,anxious,Oh no  have you been able to calm yourself down?,My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.,3460
3461,anxious,I can understand that  I think I would be a mess too.,She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.,3461
3462,angry,That does not sound plpeasant at all  maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.,I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.,3462
3463,angry,Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?,I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay  but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.,3463
3464,prepared,I bet you are  that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?,I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.,3464
3465,prepared,How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency  and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous  and proud in a vicarious kind of way.,I did  two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.,3465
3466,excited,Well good luck with that!,I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.,3466
3467,excited,What are you studying?,Thank you  I have been compiling  data for 5 years  my brain is totally absorbed by it.,3467
3468,apprehensive,Do roller coasters scare you,I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.,3468
3469,apprehensive,I used to be afriad of heights too,I think it was just the thought of being so high up.,3469
3470,lonely,That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.,I had to stay home and work  while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.,3470
3471,lonely,Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.,Hopefully  but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.,3471
3472,sad,Goodness  you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.,In some ways  losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent  they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.,3472
3473,sad,I'm so very sorry for your loss  I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.,Exactly  and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago  I honestly thought I would die too.,3473
3474,excited,It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way  unfortunately.,A week before my cruise this summer  I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.,3474
3475,excited,That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!,Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!,3475
3476,proud,And how is she doing now,When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped. ,3476
3477,proud,That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need,She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade,3477
3478,sad,aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!,I finally had a day of  but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.,3478
3479,sad,bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!,I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.,3479
3480,afraid,Oh that sounds fun!,I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious,3480
3481,afraid,That isn't good at all  glad you didn't have an accident. ,Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.,3481
3482,surprised,Did you find any good companies.,I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes,3482
3483,surprised,Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.,a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is,3483
3484,guilty,It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!,I just ate a whole cake by myself  I feel sick!,3484
3485,guilty,I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it  just try better tomorrow.,Thank you  being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house. ,3485
3486,anxious,That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?,The other night I had a panic attack out the blue ,3486
3487,anxious,Are you able to do anything to prevent them?,Sadly no  I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about. ,3487
3488,disappointed,I'm sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.,I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.,3488
3489,disappointed,Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them. ,We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.,3489
3490,lonely,Aww  I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?,I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months  and everything was fine. Then...nothing.,3490
3491,lonely,That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.,"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay  thanks for the memories. But it was rough.",3491
3492,grateful,How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward  as the saying goes.,Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice  I was so thankful because money has been tight.,3492
3493,grateful,Kindness is infectious.,I will  you never know when someone else is in need! ,3493
3494,impressed,How exciting  is he a non-traditional student?,My husband started college this week!,3494
3495,impressed,That is really good  speaking from experience  all military men and women should get a degree.,Yes  he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!,3495
3496,disgusted,Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.,I am a really picky eater  and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.,3496
3497,disgusted,Oh gosh  that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right  and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!,No poisoning  but my burger had a long hair in it  so I couldn't eat it.,3497
3498,embarrassed,Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.,I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air,3498
3499,embarrassed,Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing  coffee on light colors stinks!,I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards ,3499
3500,terrified,Oh no! What happened?,Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid  I was really frightened the other night.,3500
3501,terrified,Oh man! I would have been so scared! ,I went for a drink downstairs  and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night lol.,3501
3502,angry,Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?,My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!,3502
3503,angry,Yeah  that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.,People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing  it gets so annoying! ,3503
3504,content,I do that all the time  no big deal.,I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.,3504
3505,content,What kind of pizza did you eat?,I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.,3505
3506,content,That is such a relief  it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. ,When I got my first paycheck with a bonus  I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!,3506
3507,content,Oh yeah  retirement will come before you know it  it is good to be prepared! ,Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat  so it really was a relief  like you said.,3507
3508,anxious,Oh wow  now that really is exciting  congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?,Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!,3508
3509,anxious,Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!,I am teaching at a small private school  so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited  just nervous. ,3509
3510,sad,That sucks  will she not let you see the dog at all?,I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce,3510
3511,sad,Yes  that is probably a positive.,No we are not on speaking terms  It's pretty unfair  thankfully we didn't have a kid together.,3511
3512,annoyed,Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!,Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.,3512
3513,annoyed,Man that sounds really stressful...,They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.,3513
3514,proud,oh that is awesome. what does she do?,My sister got a promotion at work last week!,3514
3515,proud,that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.,She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :),3515
3516,impressed,Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.,My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit  and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud  like a dad  even though we're roughly the same age.,3516
3517,impressed,I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!,Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.,3517
3518,anticipating,don't be. i'm sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure,My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!,3518
3519,anticipating,i'm sure he's cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.,I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him  just not used to not being there with him.,3519
3520,anticipating,it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see,Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?,3520
3521,anticipating,it's very exciting. i wish you both all the best.,Cant wait to see what he can do   Its exciting too!  ,3521
3522,joyful,I remember that console  that's old school.,I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.,3522
3523,joyful,Those were the good old days!,It sure is now  but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.,3523
3524,disappointed,are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?,I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.,3524
3525,disappointed,thats good.. well you are on your way up!,I found a study group  I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.,3525
3526,surprised,Thats awesome  can we trade?,I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made! ,3526
3527,surprised,That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready  unlike mine,Haha my husband plays video games as well  but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.,3527
3528,annoyed,that is very true,Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!,3528
3529,annoyed,hopefully its better tomorrow!,Not only did I have a rough morning because of it  but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.,3529
3530,disappointed,Hmm  that's interesting tell me more about what that number means to you.,4,3530
3531,disappointed,Really  my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five  scared the poop out of me,Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon  they carry something in their nails/claws.,3531
3532,joyful,Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult  I'm glad that it is working for you.,I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday,3532
3533,joyful,5,Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts  good thing I'm not allergic,3533
3534,content,That is fantastic. Any good new lately?,I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am,3534
3535,content,That is an amazing feeling. ,Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life! ,3535
3536,disgusted,did you go to the doctor,I had such a bad cold last week  I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.,3536
3537,disgusted,yuk for sure,No  thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still  I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.,3537
3538,furious,Well  did you eat her ice cream?,No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it  my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!,3538
3539,furious,I wonder who actually ate it then.,I certainly would have liked to  but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it  I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.,3539
3540,furious,So are you saying it could be the guy?,She probably did  during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am  drunk  with some random guy she brought home from the club.,3540
3541,apprehensive,You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.,I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week  and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.,3541
3542,apprehensive,Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. ,I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books  and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.,3542
3543,joyful,That would be pretty cool to see  but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you  did it?,I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome,3543
3544,joyful,Ahh  okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still  that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!,I attacked it with some pets  it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing,3544
3545,hopeful,Nice  I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared  but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever,I'm taking my midterm exam this week  and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot  and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!,3545
3546,hopeful,Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal,That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course  and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.,3546
3547,nostalgic,i bet it does bud  I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it,I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her  seeing all that stuff.,3547
3548,nostalgic,yes i know  good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.,Well  I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason  and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it  you know?,3548
3549,afraid,sometimes they cant avoid it ,Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.,3549
3550,afraid,ok,I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!,3550
3551,afraid,I cant imagine how scared you must have been.,I understand  but coming at me head on  on a two lane highway  while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.,3551
3552,afraid,Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?,Uh oh  did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.,3552
3553,terrified,Oh god. Was it big?,I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!,3553
3554,terrified,Well  maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.,Yes  im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.,3554
3555,proud,what does she draw,I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.,3555
3556,proud,thats awesome,Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young  so she has a way to go  but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.,3556
3557,trusting,Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?,I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems  but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise. ,3557
3558,trusting,Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!,I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life  and she's always been supportive.,3558
3559,surprised,I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?,I have some bad news  unfortunately. Well  bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.,3559
3560,surprised,Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!,It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health  and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.,3560
3561,terrified,Did you find out what happened?,I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.,3561
3562,terrified,Man. That must've been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?,Not a chance! I was too scared to go out  and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.,3562
3563,anticipating,did it turn out ok ?,I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.,3563
3564,anticipating,hopes he continues to get better,Seems to have  yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year  but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.,3564
3565,devastated,I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.,I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...,3565
3566,devastated,I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus  it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!,I might look into that  thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore  it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids  is a big one.,3566
3567,nostalgic,Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?,Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly,3567
3568,nostalgic,I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it,Super smash bros is a classic  never gets old  but yeah you're right,3568
3569,anxious,Oh  how did it go?,I had a job interview recently,3569
3570,anxious,I'm sorry  I am sure you will be ready next time.,Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.,3570
3571,jealous,Wait  why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!,Speaking of co-workers  one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes  and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.,3571
3572,jealous,I think you need to look at the bigger picture  though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.,Yeah  yeah  yeah. Amazing and all  but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.,3572
3573,lonely,What movie did you see,I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me,3573
3574,lonely,Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest,Jurassic World. It was okay.,3574
3575,annoyed,Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?,I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.,3575
3576,annoyed,Damn well  he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.,Yeah  he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge. ,3576
3577,sad,It is indeed unfair  they shouldn't have done that,I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones,3577
3578,sad,you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!,I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms,3578
3579,embarrassed,I bet that was awkward,I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom  but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain,3579
3580,embarrassed,I guess that happens sometimes  did you finish the game,Yeah  nobody said anything,3580
3581,angry,That is terrible and a little odd!,My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!,3581
3582,angry,Wait  you were ok with her cheating?,Yeah  tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men  but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!,3582
3583,caring,Yes indeed! what did you do?,I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.,3583
3584,caring,You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!,I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.,3584
3585,disappointed,That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!,Speaking of kids in school  I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.,3585
3586,disappointed,Oh  I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know  he could turn it around next year and blow you away!,No no  see  it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average  I guess. :(,3586
3587,joyful,Wow  is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog.,So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?,3587
3588,joyful,Wow  that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!,I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though  and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay  we get it  you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant  cool.,3588
3589,confident,Dang  that's a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound  you did. But that doesn't hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday.,I mean  let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs  I knew I had that thing in the bag.,3589
3590,confident,How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out  friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!,Ah  I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned  however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!,3590
3591,grateful,That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?,I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though,3591
3592,grateful,That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.,Yes  I feel much better now.,3592
3593,sentimental,That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.,I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.,3593
3594,sentimental,Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?,Yes  it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time  before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh  I do miss her though. She was just the best!,3594
3595,annoyed,That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!,My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.,3595
3596,annoyed,Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!,I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.,3596
3597,impressed,Holy moses  he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.,Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.,3597
3598,impressed,Yeah  that's what they tell everyone because  in reality  they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.,Child's play is right  the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have  because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large  which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.,3598
3599,jealous,Ahh  that's too bad  did you mention it to your boss?,I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.,3599
3600,jealous,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!,My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions  probably a bad idea. ,3600
3601,sad,I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.,My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.,3601
3602,sad,I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.,Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected. ,3602
3603,lonely,Time will make it better. You just have to move on.,I broke up with my boyfriend last week  and nothing is the same without him.,3603
3604,lonely,Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.,Yeah  I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.,3604
3605,content,Really? What kind was it?,I just made the most delicious pie,3605
3606,content,Oh I love apple pie with ice cream  it's such a good combination,It was apple pit   I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.,3606
3607,confident,Nice  I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.,I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.,3607
3608,confident,How much did you pay for them?,I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's,3608
3609,content,I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.,I just went camping and build the warmest fire.,3609
3610,content,Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.,Yeah  I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.,3610
3611,afraid,That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.,I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.,3611
3612,afraid,Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.,I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.,3612
3613,apprehensive,Why are you worried?,I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai,3613
3614,apprehensive,That is true but Dubai is a bit better,These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic ,3614
3615,trusting,Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?,I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.,3615
3616,trusting,You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.,Of course  I'm not worried no one would steal from me.,3616
3617,anxious,why? are you having financial problems?,I can't help feel stressed about money,3617
3618,anxious,oh god   that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!,Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700,3618
3619,lonely,Oh no  what did you do to stay cheerful ?,I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family,3619
3620,lonely,Sounds good  when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?,lol I played xbox games,3620

3622,content,i'm glad you feel good today!,Blood pressure and crohns disease  as well as  a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well  woke up happy and energized,3622
3623,prepared,lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!,You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions  and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.,3623
3624,prepared,And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!,Ahh  then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard  people.,3624
3625,anticipating,That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.,I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.,3625
3626,anticipating,Amen  me too.   I hate my current job.,I'm hoping for the best  but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!,3626
3627,joyful,It's not crazy! I'm all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house,This is going to sound really pathetic  but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!,3627
3628,joyful,I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) I bet it will smell so good,Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.,3628
3629,proud,That's good. I know that would be difficult.,My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.,3629
3630,proud,That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!,She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha,3630
3631,apprehensive,That's always both an exciting time and a nerve-wracking time. I'm in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year  I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put  even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?,I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.,3631
3632,apprehensive,Oh yeah  I know the type. Where they sound like they're having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily (or unluckily  if you want to see it that way) I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment  so even if they did make noise  I couldn't hear them over it!,Not really  but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!,3632
3633,apprehensive,Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?,Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.,3633
3634,apprehensive,That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!,It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do. ,3634
3635,nostalgic,Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!,Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?,3635
3636,nostalgic,I agree and time jut goes by too fast!,It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean  I love my life right now  but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.,3636
3637,nostalgic,Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?,I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.,3637
3638,nostalgic,Exhaust all options  social media is a big way to stay connected,As much as I can  but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.,3638
3639,impressed,Wow!  What was in the package?,Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently  one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me  without my saying anything!,3639
3640,impressed,That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.,It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled  so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries  so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.,3640
3641,nostalgic,Nice do you still keep in touch with her,My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh  i miss her so much,3641
3642,nostalgic,Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her,yes but she lives in a different country  different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer,3642
3643,content,What book do you enjoy reading?,For me  one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.,3643
3644,content,No  actually I'm under a lot of stress right now and I'm in pretty dire straights financially. The only book i'm really reading at this time is the Bible.,Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?,3644
3645,disgusted,Where is your home village?,My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!,3645
3646,disgusted,"That's a shame. I""m sorry to hear that.",In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place  and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!,3646
3647,disgusted,Do you live in the United States now?,Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day  but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.,3647
3648,disgusted,Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.,Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.,3648
3649,caring,I love dogs! What breed is he?,i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need,3649
3650,caring,That's so sweet! We have blue healers  they just make the world better.,he is a french puddle and i love him very much,3650
3651,surprised,Oh my goodness  that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on.,"One time as a surprise for my birthday  my college friends ""kidnapped me""",3651
3652,surprised,Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?,Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).,3652

3654,angry,GOod for you  I feel bad for never helping out.,yes i go to my local charity every weekend,3654
3655,surprised,Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.,I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.,3655
3656,surprised,Don't spend it all in one place :),I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much. ,3656
3657,surprised,Putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet. ,I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :),3657
3658,ashamed,Haha  that's a nice way to enjoy a sad moment  how are you feeling recently?,I was really lonely and depressed at one point  and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.,3658
3659,ashamed,I'm happy to hear you're doing better. If you feel that way again please reach out.,Much better  thanks :)  Yeah  I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.,3659
3660,furious,Oh my  you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.,I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!,3660
3661,furious,Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.,I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him ,3661
3662,confident,What prize was it  or what was the competition  rather? I'm interested to know  but don't want to pry  if you don't feel like saying.,I was confident that I was going to win that prize,3662
3663,confident,Ah  gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things  myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.,It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok,3663
3664,apprehensive,Was it any good?,We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap,3664
3665,apprehensive,Sometimes the cheap things are the best,It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was ,3665
3666,sad,I bet it is! When my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain. She broke her hip right before her death and she just couldn't recover,it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother,3666
3667,sad,i hope she will recover soon. Stay strong and think positive,yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital,3667
3668,anticipating,where is that ?,I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents,3668

3672,prepared,I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods,I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods,3672
3673,surprised,That sounds peculiar. I've never known a dog with such finesse  yours may have talent.,I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag  gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch  and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.,3673
3674,surprised,That's really cool  it makes me want to consider getting a dog.,He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.,3674
3675,impressed,what did she do ?,I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good,3675
3676,impressed,wow that was nice of her,We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents,3676

3682,proud,keep it up!,Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years  yes it is. Thanks!,3682
3683,furious,That sounds frustrating. How did it affect you?,I am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine.,3683
3684,furious,Ooh  that would be aggravating. I guess there isn't much you can do.,It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.,3684
3685,hopeful,Best of luck! What are you bidding for,I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid,3685
3686,hopeful,Archie? marvel? dc?,I am bidding on a rare comic book,3686
3687,terrified,Sometimes dogs just bark a lot. Did anything happen?,I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.,3687
3688,terrified,Thank goodness. I'd be scared  too. You can't really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes.,Thankfully not really  it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it  but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.,3688
3689,impressed,It has  what did you see that impressed you?,it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days,3689

3691,guilty,What did i tell you about doing that. It was a chocolate cake right?,I ate an entire cake last night ,3691
3692,guilty,Ok  at least it was the right kind of cake you liked. But still not a good thing.,It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating ,3692
3693,prepared,That is really great.  You don't find too many people willing to help others financially.  Do you have a really good job?,I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it,3693
3694,prepared,It's good just to have enough these days.,Ehh  its not the best but it's not bad either\,3694
3695,afraid,Which film was it?,I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater,3695
3696,afraid,I haven't heard of it  sounds interesting though.,It was the First Purge,3696
3697,surprised,That's good. I live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love ,Wandering around my little area of the world I am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here. I didn't expect it.,3697
3698,surprised,wow even organic store? that's pretty cool,Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well  I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.,3698
3699,disgusted,Really? It doesn't bother me at all. I wonder why you feel that way?,i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up,3699
3700,disgusted,Well  most people have intense likes and dislikes. Personally  I can't stand cigar smoke  but some people love it! I guess in your case  you need to scrape the food off the plate first.,because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know  such a yucky feeling,3700
3701,angry,I can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!,i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor,3701
3702,angry,What an annoyance!,yeah they even have a bin specially for that,3702
3703,annoyed,Oh me too. I'm not a driver but that is so annoying.,i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it,3703
3704,annoyed,It can be really dangerous too,yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things,3704
3705,disgusted,That is terrible.  Was it dead or just injured?,I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard,3705
3706,disgusted,That is true.  I would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house  too.  Do you know who it was?,Thank goodness it was dead  poor thing is not suffering  but some people can be so cruel.,3706
3707,apprehensive,What's been holding you back?,We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.,3707
3708,apprehensive,That's a tough decision to make. It's good to try new things sometimes and I'm sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal you'll enjoy based off your preferences.,It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though,3708
3709,joyful,That is very cool!  I love when food is authentic.  Do you shop there often?,Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven  heaven  heaven!,3709
3710,joyful,I have never tried making Indian food myself  but I do really enjoy Indian restaurants.  I am jealous.  ,About once a week. Her husband works in the store  so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!,3710
3711,confident,That's awesome!  Have you gotten any better yet?,I have been working on  my jump shot all month.,3711
3712,confident,That would be cool.  Hopefully the hard work will pay off,I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.,3712
3713,annoyed,Urgh that sounds like the worst! How early?,One of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning Very Loudly.,3713
3714,annoyed,So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!,Not until about 8am  but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!,3714
3715,annoyed,Me too! ,Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!,3715
3716,annoyed,How many times do you need to tell them!? :(,I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!,3716
3717,anticipating,I tend to believe that those who have Biblical faith do have a certainty  that God will bless them despite circumstances. ,Nothing in life is certain  the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.,3717
3718,anticipating,Oh really  when are you going to go see her?,I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.,3718
3719,anticipating,I hope you have a good time at the concert  and she sings all the songs you're looking forward to.,The show is in three months  I hope she sings he late 90s hits.,3719
3720,anticipating,Congratulations! That must have been such a great feeling.,Our Property Management team just emailed me to say I've got the apartment I wanted!,3720
3721,anticipating,I can't wait for the day I move out into my own place!,It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment  but quieter (I hope!).,3721
3722,anticipating,I do  I live with my parents because I'm in university and I'm still pretty young. Hopefully by next year!,You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?,3722

3860,disappointed,Thats never good  I love pizza,A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!,3860
3861,afraid,Oh no! That must be so frustrating being in a foreign country,When I was in Costa Rica I was having a lot of trouble with the address of my AirBnB  I was so lost.,3861
3862,afraid,I'm glad you eventually found it and didn't have to sleep somewhere else.,It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking  it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.,3862

3874,annoyed,Did he do it?  Cause if not  I might have needed to give him a high five  on the head  with a chair.,I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how  but I just asked him to turn it down,3874
3875,disgusted,That is pretty disgusting! Did it look like poo coming out again?,My dog tried to eat her poo,3875
3876,disgusted,I can imagine. Maybe it'll morph into a Super Saiyan poo or something.,It probably will. ,3876

3880,surprised,you got a great husband,It was  and he does that type of thing a lot.,3880
3881,trusting,I know how you feel  it's terrible. I actually moved to a completely different state due to hi taxes.,I have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property.,3881
3882,trusting,It's worth it to consider. I pay less than half in property tax than I used to.,Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes. ,3882
3883,faithful,Always do the same what? What is perfect?,I always do the same  it's not had when they are perfect.,3883

3886,trusting,You have been very lucky. You should keep their business card in case you ever decide to buy another house.,Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.,3886
3887,trusting,I hate when that happens!,I gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn't yet. ,3887
3888,trusting,That's how it goes. I usually consider the money as a lost cause when lending to friends.,I really thought  I could count on her  but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.,3888
3889,ashamed,Did what?,I actually did this  i'm terrible.,3889
3890,ashamed,I have too... to pay for food though. She told me that she would have paid if I asked but I am too proud.,I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.,3890

4178,guilty,I agree. So often does pride get in the way of personal growth and reflection.,I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.,4178
4179,guilty,You'd hope folks would grow up  but sometimes people get set in their ways  and become impossible to change.,Absolutely. Yet  these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you  even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.,4179
4180,anxious,Oh no  what did they say? ,I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online  but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.,4180

I think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages Feel free to also call me if you need anything! :),They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish  and it makes me very anxious.,4181
4182,afraid,That sounds fun and scary! You must be pretty fit to take on that challenge.,I'm going rock climbing with some friends!,4182
4183,afraid,I'm sure that there will be some differences  but I'm sure you will nail it! Just remember to be safe!,I have done some climbing indoors for practice  but never done a big climb out doors  so who know how it will go.,4183
4184,afraid,oh my  what are they about?,I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.,4184
4185,afraid,wow sounds like some inception plot line  you need to learn how to control the dream,I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with  and roam around in the dream until I get stalked  jumped  and sometimes very hurt.,4185
4186,impressed,Sound like you're making a lot of progress!,Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago  I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.,4186
4187,impressed,That's great! All the hard work is paying off.,I sure have  but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out  even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.,4187
4188,grateful,Congrats  that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth.,I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.,4188
4189,grateful,You sound like a great mother. I'm sure your son is very lucky to have you.,It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty  but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.,4189
4190,proud,Wow that sounds challenging! You must have some serious strength to pull that off!,I just learned my first trick in ice skating  a triple spin twirl kick front flip.,4190
4191,proud,You should definitely try! It would be tough  but if you have the determination  it would be so worth it.,I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics. ,4191
4192,lonely,Oh no! You should try to make some more friends with your classmates.,I just started college again  and while I'm doing great in school  it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.,4192
4193,lonely,I hope you're able to find some friends in the next semester then!,That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses  so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.,4193
4194,terrified,Yeah that sounds hectic. You think you can do it?,This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.,4194
4195,terrified,Yeah sounds like a handful! Maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family. ,I'm not sure. The more I think about it  the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby  so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.,4195

4288,furious,I can imagine. did they steal anything?,I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating,4288
4289,nostalgic,I know what you mean.  I love to see all the pictures  and think back to how little mine used to be.,Every year when the kids go back to school  it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.,4289

4291,ashamed,Sometimes it's ok to indulge. Did it give you a stomachache though lol?,So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints  and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.,4291
4292,ashamed,You should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out. I know that feeling though.

4301,disappointed,oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind,My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.,4301
4302,disappointed,I am sure they had their reasons  maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now. ,I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.,4302
4303,content,I agree. The sound of birdsong  a gentle breeze on a summer's day  the purring of your tabby-cat. You can't beat that  can you?,The older I get  the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.,4303
4304,content,You should! Forget about your worries  if only for a moment. You'll return feeling refreshed.,Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.,4304
4305,embarrassed,Yikes  that's not a fun situation. Did you figure it out pretty quickly?,I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up  my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.,4305

I hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve.,I'm learning to live my live without her  it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.,4320
4321,faithful,Sugar is very addicting! I'm glad you could make it,I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.,4321
4322,faithful,Caffeine headaches are no joke.,Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.,4322
4323,ashamed,Sounds like you were just misunderstood. I discuss things with my husband  too  and it's not like talking behind someone's back. That's what married couples do. Don't feel bad. ,I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt  my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced  which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.,4323
4324,ashamed,Yes  just tell her your home is a safe place to talk. It's okay to open up in the family. ,Yeah  I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter  even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..,4324
4325,nostalgic,Awesome! Did you play any of them after you found the box?,I found huge box full of my old cd's recently  found a ton of old pc games i used to play  reminded me of a simpler time!,4325

4327,devastated,Ugh  sorry! You must be disappointed. But remember if the door doesn't open  it probably wasn't yours. There's something else in store for you!,I got turned down for a job I really wanted.,4327
4328,devastated,Sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion...the same thing happened to my husband. Your time will come.,Thanks.  But yes  I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.,4328
4329,hopeful,I can't even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.,When my wife left me  i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest  I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic ,4329
4330,hopeful,You might  but I believe you can have a full life as a single person  too.,Well  Like the saying goes  get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!,4330
4331,trusting,Wow! A 20 foot boat  that must be amazing to take out on the lake! How much did it cost you?,I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.,4331
4332,trusting,Id love to own a boat  are you using it for leisure or fishing etc? ,It cost me around $30 000. It has all the latest features  that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions. ,4332
4333,trusting,They both sound like great plans! Tubing would be a great way to keep her happy while you fish haha!,It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy. ,4333
4334,trusting,I hope you do! It makes you feel like you've actually earned it!,We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it. ,4334
4335,trusting,I'm always leery of loaning money to friends,I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.,4335
4336,trusting,That was a nice surprise!  I have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back,Yeah  I meant don't like  sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.,4336
4337,devastated,Oh no! How sad! Did you ever find him?,Last summer  my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.,4337
4338,devastated,Oh  how awful! I'm so sorry!,After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters  a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.,4338

4340,content,Is it though? haha. If you can do it without falling down then you are doing better than me. Probably a good bonding experience i'd imagine. ,It can be scary some times  but its worth it.,4340
4341,disappointed,Too bad for them! My sons 6th birthday was just last week  and we had a fun party. There so much easier to please when their little lol.,My daughters 6th birthday was recently  unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up  even though they all rsvp'd,4341
4342,disappointed,They do. I can't believe how fast the time goes.,Hah yea  she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast. ,4342
4343,ashamed,That must have been aggravating! Job hunting is so hard.,The other week  a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.,4343
4344,ashamed,Maybe something better will come along!,It would have been nice. Less pay  but I would have had to work less. Oh well  guess I'll try harder next time.,4344
4345,ashamed,Well I hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened.,The other day I was running late. So  I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.,4345
4346,ashamed,Oh know! I hope you weren't heading to a job interview  haha.,I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.,4346
4347,embarrassed,I'm so sorry. Have you tried any natural remedies?,I have MS  and sometimes I have bowl problems.,4347
4348,embarrassed,I hope you find something that gives you some relief!,No  I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.,4348

4350,jealous,Haha I would've done the same. Those toys always make me lose myself. They're so much fun!,No  his grandpa did. But  after he went to bed  I went outside and played with it for a while.,4350
4351,furious,Wow you were lucky! It has happened to me before too. It feels so violating.,Someone broke into my car the other day  but they didnt steal anything.,4351
4352,furious,Because you were not in it. :),I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.,4352
4353,caring,That is so nice of you all! I know she appreciates it.,There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help  we took turns helping her. ,4353
4354,caring,Aww  I'm so sorry but know you made a difference in her life.,When I saw that she needed help  I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.,4354

4359,sentimental,First day of school I remember  my kids first day of school  how did it make you feel?,I was looking at some old pictures of my kids' first day of school from 4 years ago.,4359
4360,sentimental,yes it does but we always got or memories.,It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.,4360
4361,devastated,Neither could I.  It was the first thing that was on the news right after I woke up.,I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.,4361
4362,devastated,Yea  I try not to think about that though because then it makes me sad.,Sometimes you think people will be around forever  their aura is just so...legendary.,4362
4363,content,That sounds amazing! How long does it take to make the beans? Do you have to soak them? ,I just finished eating dinner.  We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!,4363
4364,content,I can smell the beans and sausage as we speak.. I always find after cooking I'm never hungry. Maybe that's because I snacked the entire time I was cooking.,I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!,4364
4365,devastated,Oh no.  In those cases  it's either the best news or the worst news.,Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.,4365
4366,devastated,I'm sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately  I know that same feeling all too well.,Yeah  it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.,4366
4367,confident,Woo hoo! That is awesome! Congrats! When will you find out/,I think I aced my supervisor exam!,4367

4371,caring,Oh no!  That's such a shame.  Did you go to the principal?,My daughter is in 8th grade and just started school a little over a week ago. She is already being bullied.,4371
4372,caring,I'm so sorry!  I hope it gets better for her.  Middle school is no picnic  that's for sure.,Yes  and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs  goofy moments  and whatever else I can think of.,4372
4373,faithful,Oh no! That's horrible. Please tell me you didn't. ,I had a chance to cheat on my wife once ,4373

4377,caring,Do you like cats? Kittens are the best!,My roommate recently got a kitten  and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.,4377
4378,caring,Yes I love cats as well I have one orange one and 4 dogs that get along pretty well all together,I love cats  I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.,4378

4381,embarrassed,Oh dear that's embarrassing! I hope you didn't hurt yourself. ,I slipped and feel at work the other day. Several people saw it. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards.,4381
4382,embarrassed,Oh ha! I guess that's painful!,Just my pride,4382
4383,furious,I am sorry. Breakups are the worst. Did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked 70hours always?,My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork  like 70 plus hours a week.,4383
4384,furious,That's rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you. Never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for.,He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.,4384
4385,hopeful,Why did yall break up?,My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it  we've been getting along great since we broke up.,4385
4386,hopeful,That doesnt leave much time for yalls relationship,The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.,4386
4387,disappointed,Oh darn I hate when that happens! I've experienced the same thing in the past once.,I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.,4387
4388,disappointed,Yep not always a terrible time to eat out at least.,Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food  and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.,4388

4392,disgusted,what happened why were their so many dead fish?,I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.,4392
4393,disgusted,I hope they are not using the lake for drinking water .,I don't know  that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped  and they died. I imagine it was pollution. ,4393
4394,anxious,Good luck! I'm sure it will be fine.,I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league. ,4394
4395,anxious,You're too hard on yourself. Everyone messes up sometimes  even the greats.,I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself. ,4395
4396,terrified,Yikes that's no good. How many stitches did you have to get?,Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches. ,4396
4397,terrified,What happened to the dog afterwards?,I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog  a little over 50 pounds.,4397

4399,joyful,Oh! Gotcha! I've never played the switch but I heard it's an exciting console!,I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet  but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.,4399
4400,faithful,Oh cool  where does your friend live? Is it an exciting location?,I am visiting my friend this week.,4400

4402,afraid,Oh no  I bet your parents were freaking out.,One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek  my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble  and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.,4402
4403,afraid,Oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault.,Yeah I guess they were  they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin  even though I was 7 and it was his idea. ,4403
4404,sentimental,Do you get much use out of it  or is it just collection dust?,So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.,4404
4405,sentimental,I guess you can hang on to it  or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'.,Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.,4405

4407,impressed,Understandable  i bet the had good budgeting skills and a nice job.,Yeah I know  I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.,4407
4408,angry,Oh no!! That is terrible  do you know what happened? ,I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back  and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed,4408
4409,angry,Oh no  I am sure they meant no harm  they always say that they are more curious when they are young. ,My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it,4409
4410,lonely,It will pass in time  even though it feels awful right now.,Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me  because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.,4410
4411,lonely,Aw I'm sorry. I remember feeling like that and it was horrible.,I hope so  I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now. ,4411

4413,content,What did y'all do? Did you do anything special that evening? ,Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :),4413
4414,sad,Oh  I know exactly what you mean. It's not the same as going as a kid.,I went to the zoo last month  I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos  however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.,4414
4415,sad,Yeah  it's no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes.,The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it. ,4415

4421,annoyed,Hahaha  that is so cute  I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh! ,No  the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class.

4430,furious,Oh no that is terrible  I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident? ,Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.,4430
4431,furious,Wow  that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it  because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots.,Huge dent  I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.,4431

4437,ashamed,I am really appalled at people these days.,I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.,4437
4438,hopeful,Where to?,So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.,4438
4439,hopeful,Me too. Well I hope it is to somewhere that you like.,Not sure yet  waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.,4439

4442,disgusted,I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting  but its better than throwing up in the car right ?,So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.,4442
4443,disgusted,I can imagine when something unexpected like that happens. I do hope they are ok now :) Sorry you had to witness that !,Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.,4443

I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not  my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.",4473
4474,trusting,You suffer from it more severely than most people I know  this can be devastating to people. ,If it's mild  just stomach pains for a few days.

Best thing to do is pray about it and don't be hard on yourself.,Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities  I have been in a rut lately. Last week  during revival  for the first few nights  everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit  but I couldn't for whatever reason  and it made me feel bad.,4499
4500,jealous,That's amazing! I'm so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.,Yes  I prayed about it multiple times  and by the last night  I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.,4500
4501,guilty,I've never done that but i know plenty of people who do that. Its normal every know and again but don't turn it into a daily habit!,Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.,4501
4502,guilty,Damn that sounds good  honestly its fine every know and again. we all have a sweet tooth.,Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.,4502

4505,confident,Oh thats awesome  im sure you were excited to help,I was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school  so I signed my daughters up to play. since they had an interest in it too. When we got the practice on the first day  the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if I would help a little.,4505
4506,confident,thats great  sounds like a fun time. And you got to share time with your daughters which is awesome.,I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much  so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.,4506

4510,caring,Oh  that sounds bad  probably a stomach virus. those suck!,Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot,4510
4511,content,Thats great  perfect time to unwind and relax  and earn money!,I am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap.,4511
4512,content,Awesome  sometimes they can get annoying always running around and nagging you.,Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping,4512

4516,content,That sounds wonderful! My body is craving something like this. Thanks for the inspiration!,It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.,4516
4517,disgusted,Oh no  did they do something embarrasing?,I had a get together recently  One of my friends brought someone who couldn't hold their liquor. ,4517
4518,disgusted,That's absolutely disgusting!,Heh  well they projectile vomited all over my carpet  it was gross. ,4518
4519,impressed,Did the two of you have fun?,Me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day.,4519

4521,grateful,I am sorry that you are out of work.  Have you had any job interviews? It is good that your father is able to help you during this time.,I've been out of work  and my dads been helping me financially.,4521
4522,grateful,Well  I am glad you will hopefully get some disability income.  It sounds like your dad isn't the type who expects to be repayed.  He sounds like a great parent.,No  I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him,4522
4523,anxious,Did everything work out ok? How did you like them?,I had to meet my new physical therapist this week.,4523
4524,anxious,Oh  me too. I don't even like to sit in the waiting room.,They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.,4524
4525,lonely,Interesting  are you feeling OK having less bonding time?,This is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school.,4525
4526,lonely,I see  I imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby  or school ends for the day.,Yeah  it's just too quiet lol.,4526
4527,furious,That's not very fun. I hate traveling like that.,Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.,4527
4528,furious,At least you got to see your family for a little bit.,Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.,4528
4529,annoyed,Ew  that's always the worst. What were you getting?,I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!,4529
4530,annoyed,That's always the case! So annoying. I love the self checkout options. I wish more places had that.,Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.,4530
4531,sad,Oh no! I am sorry to hear of your loss. Are you taking it ok?,I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.,4531
4532,sad,Yeah  funerals are really sad but they can make one appreciate life so much more.,I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.,4532
4533,jealous,Wow i'd be jealous,I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer,4533
4534,jealous,Same. I have a chance in a few years to go with the family but not 100%.,I am!  I would love to go myself.,4534
4535,nostalgic,I bet it is! I love getting together with friends  especially if it has been a while...which it seems to be the older I get.,My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.,4535
4536,nostalgic,I bet it would be tough.  Was there a special occasion that brought you all together?,Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.,4536
4537,nostalgic,Thats so awesome! I hope you all had a ton of fun!,No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.,4537
4538,ashamed,Hahaha  yes we women don't want to get the men angry. But clothes are so expensive these days. We just want to look good for our men.,My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.,4538
4539,ashamed, I guess you can just tell her like you told me just now. Maybe she won't be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe  lol.,I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.,4539
4540,disgusted,Yikes  that doesnt happen too often in today's culture.  Did you say anything?,This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.,4540
4541,disgusted,That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?,No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.,4541
4542,disgusted,Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.,No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.,4542
4543,disappointed,I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either. I'm sure it did make you sad.,I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently  but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.,4543
4544,disappointed,Yeah  I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon.,We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.,4544
4545,prepared,Great! Are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?,The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes  shoes  and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.,4545
4546,prepared,For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.,I'm home with my toddler  so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.,4546
4547,anxious,Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?,Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.,4547
4548,anxious,I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! :),Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.,4548
4549,furious,Oh no! that's no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad,My husband's grandfather recently passed away  and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.,4549
4550,furious,Oh that's awful and borderline abusive,It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him  while he was sick  about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.,4550
4551,nostalgic,ah  you must have great memories than,Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends. ,4551
4552,nostalgic,you know today's events are tomorrow's memories,The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back ,4552
4553,confident,Cool! What kind of fish do you expect to catch there?,I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow. I know I am going to catch something!,4553

4557,anxious,That is ,my family came to visit recently  i always get so nervous about people visiting. ,4557
4558,anxious,That is so nice when family visits. It is so much fun! But yeah  it is a lot of work for sure. ,I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive  nerve wracking!,4558
4559,anticipating,Oh  Happy early Birthday! What is it that you are hoping for?,I have a birthday coming up. I really hop I get the gift I am asking for.,4559
4560,anticipating,Nice! I hope you get it! Cameras are such a wonderful tool to have these days and there are so many cool options to choose from.,Thank you  I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade. ,4560
4561,furious,oh jeez! what a mess.,My dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house. I am so mad right now!,4561
4562,furious,I like dogs but thats why i dont have one lol,I know  it is going to take me all evening to clean up!,4562
4563,prepared,Excellent! Stay hydrated!,I am going camping this weekend. I got my tent  sleeping bag and tons of food. I think I have everything I need!,4563
4564,prepared,Sounds like fun!,Oh I will  I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!,4564
4565,terrified,Wow  that sounds quite disturbing. Was someone breaking in?,The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house  i was pretty scared. ,4565
4566,terrified,I'm glad everything turned out okay!,No  it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating. ,4566
4567,hopeful,Yeah flooding is a real problems these days. The weather is crazy! Hopefully you and your house will stay nice and dry.,It has been raining a lot lately  I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.,4567
4568,hopeful,I would be scared too. I hope everything will be ok for you. Fingers crossed.,I know  it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!,4568
4569,disappointed,you sort of gamble on store bought cakes  did you take it back?,I bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible.,4569
4570,disappointed,you are a lot bravery than I  I do't think i could it eat,No  I ended up just suffering through it and eating it. ,4570
4571,confident,Do you feel any less nervous?  Job interviews are always nerve-wracking ,I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently  I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.,4571
4572,confident,Either way  as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it.  I'm sure you'll do great!,Yea  it made me feel better about myself and my chances  or maybe i just like spending money,4572
4573,nostalgic,Oh yeah! I love chocolate anything! But grandmas cooking is always the best of all!,I love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me.,4573
4574,nostalgic,Not me! haha I love them all!,Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha. ,4574
4575,nostalgic,that must be a cute picture,I found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten 11 years ago.,4575
4576,nostalgic,so young and ready to conquer the world,It is!  In it  she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.,4576
4577,joyful,What video games are the two of you playing?,I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me  she's such a quick learner.,4577
4578,joyful,It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.,Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them  It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence. ,4578
4579,disappointed,You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.,It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.,4579
4580,disappointed,I would assume so  since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!,I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!,4580
4581,faithful,Congrats! is it a good promotion?,I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.,4581
4582,faithful,Wow that is super exciting. Not many people get that opportunity. You must have worked hard ,It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office  and not just the one section I was in!,4582
4583,anxious,Wow  that's really exciting! Good for you  you must be nervous. ,I put in to get a promotion at work  and I should know something either way by tomorrow.,4583
4584,anxious,That's great  what kind of work are you in?,On the one hand  I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.,4584
4585,anxious,Well I really hope you get it. You're right  you did what you could. ,I work for a medical supply company.,4585
4586,disgusted,That's horrible news!  I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.,Last week  they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.,4586
4587,disgusted,I know in some places  the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes. ,I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man  but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!,4587
4588,faithful,Was that a good day for you?,When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup,4588
4589,faithful,That's amazing! Sounds like a beauty day! Are you English?,So good  genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!,4589

4591,joyful,Oh  that does sound like a fun summer. I read recently that we only get 18 summers with our kids- make them count. ,It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives  cooked lots of stuff  goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand  I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.,4591
4592,joyful,It's good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes. ,Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!,4592
4593,apprehensive,Oh no  I can imagine so! Was it gunky?,I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years  after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!,4593
4594,apprehensive,Oh goodness  glad you got through is safe lol,Yes indeed  there was even a frog under there! So bizarre! ,4594
4595,furious,Oh  that's not right. I have a rescue dog  she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year. ,They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!,4595
4596,furious,I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals. ,Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.,4596
4597,furious,That's great! So sad for those poor animals. ,Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully  those animals can find good care and good homes.,4597
4598,furious,They should- they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too. ,And in my opinion  the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!,4598
4599,impressed,That sounds awesome  I'm glad he did well. ,My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.,4599
4600,impressed,I hope he gets the team he wants. ,I am  too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point  I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.,4600
4601,grateful,You must be relieved! You excited for free time?,I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!,4601
4602,grateful,That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.,"Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the  ""Mom  you always watch this!"" comment!",4602
4603,grateful,4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.,How old are they?,4603
4604,lonely,Awww that will be a boring week. Sorry to hear that. Maybe you'll be productive!,My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.,4604
4605,lonely,I hope it flies by! ,On the one hand  I hope so but on the other hand  I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD,4605
4606,afraid,Was the owner not around? Did the dog cause any harm?,I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose  a bit white husky  he was aggressive.,4606
4607,afraid,Sounds scary! Dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm,He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me  the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense. ,4607
4608,sad,That is very heartbreaking. How did you find the kitten?,The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.,4608
4609,sad,Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring  that is something to atleast be proud of!,She was under my house  crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could  but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.,4609
4610,impressed,Kids pick those things up quickly.  And it'll help with her hand-eye coordination  reading - all sorts of things!  ,My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!,4610
4611,impressed,Yeah.  Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start  Select  A and B!,Yea  i was pretty proud of her  especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid. ,4611
4612,annoyed,Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. It's hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.,I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.,4612
4613,annoyed,Sounds like a headache  i know the feeling. I got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school. Good luck!,I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!,4613
4614,grateful,That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!,I went through a divorce last year  which caught me off guard financially  luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.,4614
4615,grateful,I bet they do! I mean they do go to school for a while and study hard  plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!,Yea i'm much better now  thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.,4615
4616,lonely,i would love some quiet time to myself  consider yourself lucky!,When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy,4616
4617,lonely,i have a husband and three kids  its always loud in my house,hah  i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose. ,4617
4618,guilty,Oh no! How did you guys get caught?,When we were kids  my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza  we got caught.,4618
4619,guilty,I bet  did you both get in a lot of trouble?,My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook  i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!,4619
4620,disappointed,What movie was it?  Is it currently in theaters?,I just saw a movie I had been looking forward to and it was terrible,4620
4621,disappointed,Thats too bad! I was hoping that one was going to be good!,It was the new Jurassic World,4621
4622,furious,Oh my gosh! I would be furious as well. ,My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!,4622
4623,furious,I am sorry that happened. Don't do him any favors.,He's such a worm. I can't stand it.,4623
4624,annoyed,Yeah  you need peace and quiet to be able to work.,Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.,4624
4625,annoyed,My son keeps trying to show me Youtube videos so I completely understand,I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video  gonna pull my hair out.,4625
4626,anxious,That is normal that just means that the other person is special ,I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.,4626
4627,anxious,Well i will keep my finger crossed for you!,Yeah  I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up. ,4627
4628,disgusted,Yeah i can imagine but a little worm wont hurt ya,I bit into an apple and found a worm. It was so gross.,4628
4629,disgusted,I understand but atleast it was not poisonous ,Yeah  but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple. ,4629
4630,terrified,I live in bear country.,I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs. ,4630
4631,terrified,I bet I would have been scared,They really startled me  the female did not seem happy to see me.,4631
4632,joyful,Awwww. that is so sweet! Details. Boy  girl  breed. ,I got a new dog recently  he is the best. I am so thankful for him!,4632

4634,guilty,oopsy. I hope it was worth it. ,There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it  I ate it. I kind of feel bad.,4634
4635,guilty,LOL! Can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?,It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.,4635
4636,afraid,That sounds terrifying  so glad you did not step on it,I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.,4636
4637,afraid,I can imagine I would have nightmares about that ,Me too  that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now. ,4637
4638,afraid,And be watchful when you do!,It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park. ,4638

4642,lonely,I understand. Its tough these days.,I hope so  but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone. ,4642
4643,impressed,I love butterflies because of the colors. What color was the butterfly?,I was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo. I am really happy with how it turned out!,4643
4644,impressed,Yellow butterflies are beautiful. Photography can capture some great images a lot of times.,The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!,4644
4645,disgusted,Oh  my dog did that  too! I don't know how they think it's a tasty morsel...so gross!!,I saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time,4645
4646,disgusted,"I was just going to say the same thing! I'm like ""Stay away!"" ",Yeah  it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.,4646
4647,annoyed,I love cats.,I was trying to take a nap  but my cat kept on trying to play with my head.,4647

4652,terrified,I bet,Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash,4652
4653,guilty,How long did he think he had won?,My cousin and I tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery. I feel so bad.,4653
4654,guilty,That was funny I bet.,Only a few minutes.,4654
4655,afraid,Oh wow  did you give him the money?,Someone came to my door with a gun  asking for money,4655
4656,afraid,That would be so scary  I am glad you are safe!,I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff,4656
4657,sad,I'm so sorry to hear that. How long had your cat been with you?,Our cat had to many health problems  so we had to put him down.,4657
4658,sad,It's always hard to go through that. That's why I'm wary of having any pets,I had him for 17 years  he lived a full and happy life  but I was not ready for him to go.,4658
4659,impressed,Does he like to sing?,I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer,4659
4660,impressed,I bet he sings in the shower everyday.,He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke,4660
4661,joyful,You must have worked hard for that! I'm sure it's great and you'll pass with a flying color!,I had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate. Thankfully I passed!,4661
4662,joyful,Yeah  such a relief to get a huge project done. You must feel proud!,I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well,4662
4663,annoyed,That must be really irritating. Is she doing it deliberately?,My sister has been playing a song I dislike over and over and over,4663
4664,annoyed,Haha - maybe you'll learn to love it! There must be something good about it  if your sister has any taste.,She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks,4664
4665,excited,I've never been abroad before  but I'm going to spend two weeks in France next month!,okay.,4665
4666,excited,I am going to visit a few cities and tourist attractions.,That is great! What will you be doing there? ,4666
4667,ashamed,Oh no  did they get angry? ,I accidentally slapped someone in the face while I was playing basketball.,4667
4668,ashamed,Okay  I am glad that they were not angry. and I am sure they knew it was unintentional so don't feel too guilty about it. :) ,No  I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.,4668
4669,trusting,Wow you are very trusting  I do not think I would allow a friend to borrow my car. Is it legal for him to drive with just a permit? ,I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.,4669
4670,trusting,Oh okay I see  I thought you actually lent him your car and let him drive around town with it by himself! ,I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.,4670
4671,trusting,That's a big decision! What are your choices?,I am at a cross road. I am trying to decide my major in college.,4671
4672,trusting,If you want my advice - choose something you're going to enjoy. I personally couldn't be a nurse - too messy!,I was thinking about graphic design. Or  I was going to do something practical like Nursing.,4672
4673,hopeful,I hoep you reach your goal. It must be tiring.,I've been trying to save money so that I can help my husband with the Christmas shopping this year.,4673
4674,hopeful,Don't give up. Things may not be great one day but they always pick up eventually.,Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though  and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.,4674
4675,disappointed,that stinks were you guys going school clothes shopping?,I had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago. We were all really excited  but the plans fell through.,4675
4676,disappointed,That's good  school shopping is always stressful for me,Yes. We were able to go about a week later  but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though. ,4676
4677,faithful,okey no problem,I check in with my partner to see if we are okay. I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.,4677
4678,faithful,For mine too. That was also i said.,I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.,4678
4679,ashamed,I understand completely. One has to live within one's budget. It can be hard though.,When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?,4679
4680,ashamed,It's only normal to want to live within one's means. Too bad you can't leave a tip every time.,I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.,4680
4681,disgusted,Wow ! Thats quite unfortunate!,I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.,4681
4682,disgusted,Well handle it wisely,Yes  it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it  but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.,4682
4683,anxious,It sounds like a stressful day. You have to just live in the present so  you will not be too stress out.,I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town  which is at some unspecified time today.,4683
4684,anxious,When that is over then you can do you. We have to make time for ourselves.,Yeah  I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.,4684
4685,sentimental,I'm very sorry for your loss. Thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help.,I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.,4685
4686,sentimental,That's a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.,It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.,4686
4687,sentimental,Yes  it does. ,Yes  it is. I know that time heals.,4687
4688,caring,That can't be easy. How old are your children? Sometimes I wish we could keep our kids small forever!,My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So  I would have to let go and let them fly.,4688
4689,caring,Yeah you want them to learn  but it's definitely hard to see them doing things that you might not agree with. ,I have 23  20  17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.,4689
4690,terrified,Wow that's really scary! Labor is a really terrifying thing  especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?,When I was in labor with my third child  they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room  my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.,4690
4691,terrified,I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well. Kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!,Yes  everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.,4691
4692,proud,What platform do you play it on? PC or PS4?,I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.,4692
4693,proud,PC is the way to go for gaming. That sounds like an awesome type of game. Is it multiplayer?,PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.,4693
4694,disgusted,That's so cute. How old is she?,I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.,4694
4695,disgusted,Oh mine. That is not cute.,It's not cute  and she's nine. By old flowers I mean  it's a green  stagnant slush with mold growing on top.,4695
4696,embarrassed,That's no good. Did you go to the doctor?,When I enter the bus  I fainted. I think that I got overheated.,4696
4697,embarrassed,Got to make sure you take care of your self. It's scary when your heat sensitive.,Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.,4697
4698,ashamed,It will be okay. We sometimes do things that we regret.,I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends,4698
4699,ashamed,You have to forgive ourselves. We don't need others validation.,I fell down  and apparently said some embarrassing things. ,4699
4700,anticipating,Will you be able to spend more time with her?,My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.,4700
4701,anticipating,I can imagine  but it's good that her hard work is about to pay off.,Yes  I will. She has been under a lot of stress.,4701
4702,surprised,What'd MS?,Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.,4702
4703,surprised,Well  I pray you get through it,Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.,4703
4704,jealous,How do you feel about that ?,I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.,4704
4705,jealous,Hopefully she re considers you should talk to her about it,I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.,4705
4706,trusting,That is risky  what do you plan to do,I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.,4706
4707,trusting,Okey if she is no cause for alarm,Well  nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.,4707
4708,confident,Good. You sound confident. When is it?,I think that I will do good on my test.,4708
4709,confident,I'm sure you'll do great then!,It is tonight. I studied really hard.,4709
4710,sentimental,Oh how sweet  high school days is always fun,I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days,4710
4711,sentimental,Yes it does happen,Yes  it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young. ,4711
4712,devastated,am sorry to hear that  may he rest in peace,My dad dies when I was 33 years old.,4712

4718,apprehensive,It can been nerve-wracking to start a new job. But I'm sure you did well  right?,When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.,4718
4719,apprehensive,It's wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy. You need to build a good relationship with your new co-workers.,I did  but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.,4719
4720,guilty,I know exactly how you feel. I have a crazy addiction to soda.  I don't think I can quit!,I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day  the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.,4720
4721,guilty,Maybe try to slowly quit? Like just drink one less a day,It just makes me feel bad  that no matter how many times I try  I still give in to the temptation.,4721
4722,anticipating,When will you find out?,I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.,4722

4726,ashamed,Why couldn't you sleep?,I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.,4726
4727,ashamed,I hope so! Why are you stressed?,Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.,4727
4728,jealous,Oh  that sounds uncomfortable. How did you play it?,I saw my crush talking to another guy.,4728
4729,jealous,I respect that  I think it shows character and honor. I'm hoping something rewarding comes your way.,I was a little upset  but it wasn't my business. I let it go.,4729

4731,apprehensive,I dont blame you.  I probably would have done the same thing.,No  but he seemed a little unpredictable  so I used the other door.,4731
4732,joyful,I remember that feeling with my daughter  it is indescribable.,Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.,4732
4733,joyful,There is nothing to compare it to. I wish I hadn't been waking from anesthesia in that moment so I could have been more awake. ,Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.,4733
4734,ashamed,Oh no! It happens to the best of us :) Have you talked to her about it when you remembered?,I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!,4734

4736,sentimental,Oh  how cool! Dd you and your dad play together?,I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day  and I found all my old paintball gear.,4736
4737,sentimental,That's great. It'll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.,No  just me. But  I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.,4737
4738,apprehensive,Wow  that is scary. Were you nervous?,I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!,4738

4741,devastated,Yeah I would have been too. As a nine year old kid that's hard to deal with. ,I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.,4741
4742,embarrassed,Ouch! Was it a serious fall?,I tripped and fell in front of some people.,4742
4743,embarrassed,That's a relatively quick recovery  fortunately. ,No  only my pride was injured.,4743

4747,proud,Cool  I guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!,I did  mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off. ,4747
4748,excited,Ooh nice. That does sound like alot of fun. Do you guys play any sport while your there? ,I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends  it should be so much fun!,4748

4750,excited,Yeah  I haven't seen my friends in forever. We don't even live in the same state anymore.,Me too  there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!,4750
4751,guilty,I understand that feeling. I've had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too. Has your diet been going well otherwise?,I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.,4751

4754,devastated,It will probably be where you least expect it!,I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!,4754
4755,trusting,Oh wow.  How did she do?,I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.,4755
4756,trusting,That's awesome!  That's great exercise! ,She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.,4756
4757,furious,Oh  no! That's so terrible!,It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.,4757

4778,afraid,lol. well that's no good. cleaning garages bites. ,Nice! We have a garage  but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.,4778
4779,impressed,i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar,I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker.

4803,jealous,Omg  I bet they come home so spoiled.,Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies  and get new toys.,4803

4853,impressed,That is amazing. She is a very smart girl.,The other day  my three year old didn't know I was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog. I overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten.,4853
4854,impressed,You must be proud of her. That is a lucky dog  a bark for each count. Haha.,Yes  I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.,4854

4860,ashamed,LOL I don't think so. I think you'll be fine  maybe you were just extra tired.,Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?,4860
4861,trusting,Lol! I don't think i would trust that concoction if i were you.,My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it  it would cure my herpes.,4861
4862,trusting,Well then. Kudos to uncle Jeb!,"Listen  my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """"""snake oil"""""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all  it worked.",4862

4867,devastated,Okay  well if you have it then you would have to see a doctor.,Look  can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.,4867
4868,devastated,Now that is interesting  I wish you the best of luck.,I saw one  and he said if I gave him $25 000 he would clear me for flight  but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.,4868
4869,prepared,Oh really? Are you afraid of missing out on something?,I am obsessive about being ready for anything,4869
4870,prepared,Well it is good to have extra food on hand these days. You never know what major event can happen.,I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!,4870
4871,caring,Oh my! Is she ok  and was it while surfing?,My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.,4871

You are great for staying there.,She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her  then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.,4872

4877,sentimental,That must have really been a wonderful surprise!,I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories! ,4877

4883,sentimental,Wow that's incredible. What was her anme?,I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.,4883
4884,sentimental,Haha thats really funny. I bet she was a special person.,Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.,4884
4885,anticipating,I am too! What are your plans?,I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.,4885
4886,anticipating,I've been to Universal and everything else around there  but sadly never during halloween  I've always wanted to.,Well In September  Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events  after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.,4886

4899,afraid,That sucks. Do you know what caused the outage?,Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!,4899
4900,afraid,You don't realize how dependent we are on electricity until the lights go out.,Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.,4900
4901,hopeful,Oh nice! That seems more likely than winning the state lottery. That would be so cool if you won!,I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car,4901
4902,hopeful,That sounds like a really nice program. Where can I buy some tickets?!,Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research,4902

4907,lonely,Oh   was it good? I've considered it.,I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.,4907
4908,lonely,Only if you are choosing that  over real tangible moments with friends or outside people.,It is good  but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.,4908
4909,furious,That would take a miracle   or have some major money backing it.,I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking,4909
4910,furious,Take some small steps and vote in other things for people with the right values  not just pandering to the ignorant.,Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump,4910

4920,anxious,You could have a tear on your eye. You really should get it checked out ,yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what,4920
4921,impressed,I bet that was fun  who did you go see?,Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.,4921
4922,impressed,Magic is such a cool thing. That suspension of belief.,I didn't catch his name  but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick  but I'll never forget it!,4922

4931,grateful,I feel you. Last week  I spend 1000 dollars to fix my daughter's teeth. Dentists ask a lot of money now a days.,My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.,4931
4932,grateful,Ohh well that's good for you. These kind people always help in difficult times.,Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.,4932

4951,faithful,Aww that's so cute! Did he enjoy it?,So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.,4951
4952,faithful,Poor guy was just nervous  I'm sure the more you take him the more he will venture away from you and have some fun!,It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.,4952
4953,ashamed,Well hopefully he is understanding  if he is anything like my brother nothing a cold 6 pack won't fix.,Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to,4953
4954,ashamed,All is well that ends well  especially with family they gotta give ya do overs.,Ha ha  he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.,4954

4960,impressed,Haha that;s rare when it comes to mechanics.,I was able to go home  but I realize now that I didn't even have to,4960
4961,sad,im sorry  thats awful. its a shame his parents arent being more supportive,My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.,4961
4962,sad,im sure he appreciates having you around though,They aren't being supportive at all  but that's not surprising  that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him  but I can't,4962
4963,grateful,That was really nice of them. I bet you're appreciative.,I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow,4963
4964,grateful,I'm sure you'll do a favor for them in the future.,Yes I am  they are great,4964

4966,disgusted,Yeah  me either. Hopefully they regret what they did and are able to learn something from this.,Yes  it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people,4966
4967,nostalgic,I enjoyed highschool  too.,I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best,4967
4968,nostalgic,College was pretty laid back for me  I did a lot of online classes.,That's great. College was also fun,4968
4969,sad,I am sorry for your loss. I hope you can find comfort during this difficult time.,I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her,4969
4970,sad,You will  and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!,Thank you  that means a lot. I will see her again,4970
4971,angry,Happens to everybody. My girlfriend  who is the smartest person I know  has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important  that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case  too!,I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!,4971
4972,angry,I've heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home  or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together.,That's pretty funny  and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!,4972
4973,surprised,Wow. That must be a very special friend. I net you were surprised.,I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.,4973
4974,surprised,Oh dear. Maybe he is a loner and doesn't like friends.,Yeah I sure was  he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.,4974
4975,faithful,oh that's just a recipe for disaster 100% of the time.,One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.,4975
4976,faithful,mine has too. i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.,Yeah I figured it was  so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.,4976
4977,trusting,Hm  who might that be? ,Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to  with one notable exception.,4977
4978,trusting,Thats neat. You must trust him a lot given his track record of making money!,My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!,4978
4979,proud,Oh my goodness!  That's amazing!  Congratulations! Was it your first gold medal race?,I finished first in a race. I feel like gold,4979
4980,proud,That is awesome! It is for running?,Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off,4980
4981,trusting,That sounds exciting and scary.  What was the surprise?,Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises  but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.,4981
4982,trusting,That is so awesome.  Did you have fun? and more important  are you a pilot now?,They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport. ,4982
4983,sentimental,That's cool  did it bring back some good memories? ,I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid,4983
4984,sentimental,I love the 90's also  best decade in my opinion!,Yeah  it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days,4984
4985,ashamed,Oh no  did you get hurt?,When I was in middle school  I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.,4985
4986,ashamed,Yikes  I'm sorry to hear that.  That sounds horrifying!,Yes  the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents  it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.   ,4986
4987,apprehensive,So what did you do?,My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him  but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.,4987
4988,apprehensive,Well  I bet your friend had a good time with you being there. Sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about.,We went  but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.,4988
4989,faithful,I'm sorry. My wife could sympathize with you since I'm gone a lot on business as well. ,My husband is on the road a lot  I hardley ever see him.,4989
4990,faithful,I'm sorry you feel lonely.  My wife says she ofens feels the same way.  I know your husband misses you awfully while he's away.  I love having chats with my wife every day when I'm gone.,Yes  its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.,4990
4991,apprehensive,Just be confident and you will do great!,I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for,4991
4992,apprehensive,You got this! ,I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard,4992
4993,apprehensive,Ah  yeah moving can be hectic! Are you moving somewhere you want to be?,I'm moving in a few months to a new state  I'm starting to feel nervous.,4993
4994,apprehensive,That's a positive at least  good luck on the move!,To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.,4994
4995,sentimental,Oh no!!! Did you see what happened to the dog?!,I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.,4995
4996,sentimental,That's so sad! What on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! That just breaks my heart.. ,It was pretty tramatic  I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No  I was on my way to work  I couldn't stop :(,4996
4997,apprehensive,I can understand the anxiety. Its a whole new different experience for first timers!,I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.,4997
4998,apprehensive,Same thing happens to me. I sometimes faint at the sight of a needle! Its good that your experience went well! Now you wont be nervous anymore. ,Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood  and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though  and now I have several!,4998
4999,caring,Aww! That is so cute! Has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet?,I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!,4999
5000,caring,That is so sweet of him. Its definitely the little things. ,He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :),5000
5001,content,Good! What's been going on?,It's been a great week! ,5001
5002,content,Woo! Congrats on that! That's always a nice surprise. What do you do?,I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting! ,5002
5003,sentimental,Yeah exactly!  Music is awesome.  ,Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?,5003
5004,sentimental,Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend :(,Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.,5004
5005,sentimental,Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler  everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did  I'd consider using it again  or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm  you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else  there should be no shame.,I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories. ,5005
5006,sentimental,Well  if I were you  I'd keep it up  whether or not my spouse laughed at me  or a new girlfriend/boyfriend  whatever. It's not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want.,Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.,5006
5007,devastated,Aw! That's horrible  I'm sorry to hear that.,My dog got hit by a car.,5007
5008,devastated,That's so sad  I don't even know what to say!,He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.,5008
5009,embarrassed,Oh no! That is really creepy  why is he in your backyard?,Some random guy was in my backyard  I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.,5009
5010,embarrassed,Yeah  that's illegal I think  they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!,Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first. ,5010
5011,devastated,I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.,My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.,5011
5012,devastated,No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.,My siblings and I are managing  and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.,5012
5013,content,What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.,I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.,5013
5014,content,Must be nice  got any nice snacks?,I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time,5014
5015,devastated,Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree. ,I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.,5015
5016,devastated,I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. ,That is what I was thinking at the time  but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.,5016
5017,embarrassed,Ah  I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?,I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.,5017
5018,embarrassed,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're not seriously hurt! ,It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.,5018
5019,caring,You're sweet  what kind of soup did you make him?,My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him,5019
5020,caring,I love chicken noodle  he must be so grateful.,I made chicken noodle soup. ,5020
5021,embarrassed,I bet that was a little embarrassing.,I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.,5021
5022,embarrassed,I am sure it was not as bad as you think. ,After I figured out what I did  I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.,5022
5023,prepared,Wow! What kind of meeting is it?,I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend. ,5023
5024,prepared,Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!,It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.,5024
5025,jealous,Oh no  was it romantic texts?,I caught my boyfriend texting his ex,5025
5026,jealous,That's sad. I hope you are OK.,It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her,5026
5027,jealous,That must be weird to talk to your ex still.,I know I broke up with my ex  but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.,5027
5028,jealous,You must have feelings for him that are lingering.,We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial  i think he does too. ,5028
5029,anticipating,Nice! It feels good to be confident. When do they come out?,I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.,5029
5030,anticipating,As you should. You must have good teachers too!,On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well,5030
5031,devastated,why? what happened to it? is it okay?,I was very upset when I found my kitten today.,5031
5032,devastated,that sounds terrible  i hope you didn't cry alot.,No  I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.,5032
5033,caring,Oh yeah?  Do you know someone that lives there?,I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.,5033
5034,caring,Yeah.  That's awesome that you do that though.  Makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff.,Not really  I take my daughter to see them  so many of them have no visitors at all.,5034
5035,caring,That sounds cool!  I bet she cooks good!,She likes to bake  so we take them what she makes :),5035
5036,caring,haha same here!  ,She is pretty good for an eleven year old  better than I was.,5036
5037,trusting,I am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely.,I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her  as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.,5037
5038,trusting,Hopefully she knows how much this means to you.,Yes  I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!,5038
5039,apprehensive,DID HE GET ACCEPTED? I HOPE SO,My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!,5039
5040,apprehensive,OMG that's amazing  good on him! you must be so proud,He did! He's in his 3rd year  going to be an Aerospace Engineer  so we are very proud of him.,5040
5041,devastated,oh wow  how did your mother handle this  how did you handle it . i can only imagine the pain.,My sister passed away several years ago. She took her life  and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful  traumatic and hard for us all.,5041
5042,devastated,that is really painful  i hope everything becomes better soon.,It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile  she was in denial. But  it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile  as she was my only sibling and we were very close.,5042
5043,caring,where did he go study at? i can imagine how hard that could be. but it's good to see him following his dreams\,When my son first started college  I felt so much love and affection  but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.,5043
5044,caring,aerospace engineer that sounds very interesting. hopefully he will stay focused and reach his goals.,He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science  engineering  etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!,5044
5045,content,aww that's amazing  i am going on vacation next week and i can't wait,We went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach  It was so relaxing and great. I really enjoyed the time with my family.,5045
5046,content,i know! i am sure you were able to recharge your batteries ,That's great! I'm sure you earned it  just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!,5046

5049,confident,How exciting! I hope everything goes as planned!,My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.,5049
5050,confident,Sounds like you have a good relationship. I hope when I get married it turns out just as good.,Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.,5050
5051,sentimental,aww. im sure you must feel proud of him,My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!,5051
5052,sentimental,that sounds so cute,Yes  very. But  time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!,5052
5053,prepared,that is good news. its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead,I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.,5053
5054,prepared,i hope you do well and excell,Yes  thank you! I had worked very hard through the years  and I felt that I earned it  and would do well at it.,5054
5055,furious,An adult did this? ,There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad  beyond angry!,5055
5056,furious,I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.,Yes  and she had two children of her own  similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle  that made her mad! Can you believe that??,5056
5057,anxious,Aww  they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?,Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.,5057
5058,anxious,haha  I'm sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.,It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing. ,5058
5059,prepared,What went wrong?,I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!,5059
5060,prepared,That is all that matters  its about the love.,I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding  I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well  it was still fun.,5060
5061,disgusted,I understand. Did you told your friend?,One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me  while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!,5061
5062,disgusted,Wow  it is terrible.,I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson  she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women  and stayed.....,5062
5063,terrified,Did you go see who it was?,The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.,5063
5064,terrified,No that's scary stuff.,No  I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.,5064
5065,joyful,That is great. What is it fun?,I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.,5065
5066,joyful,That is always difficult.,It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more,5066
5067,ashamed,I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.,A few weeks ago  my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things  and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.,5067
5068,ashamed,Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.,Yes  that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later. ,5068
5069,terrified,In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.,One night when my kids and I came home  I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.,5069
5070,terrified,I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?,Yes  and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But  luckily  it turned out to be my shadow!,5070
5071,guilty,I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.,There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do  as I feel it's my part to help those in need  as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.,5071
5072,guilty,It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!,Well  homeless people aren't common in my area  so that's why I felt a bit bad about it. ,5072
5073,joyful,Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. ,When my children were born  it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.,5073
5074,joyful,Thats perfect  a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. ,Yes  I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl  both healthy  smart and wonderful.,5074
5075,faithful,In what do you believe?,I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in  so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.,5075
5076,faithful,That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?,Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another  just because of their religion or skin color  or where they come from.,5076
5077,afraid,What car did you buy?,I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it  especially on the highway.,5077
5078,afraid,Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.,Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.,5078
5079,impressed,Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.,I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.,5079
5080,impressed,You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?,It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them,5080
5081,apprehensive,That test seems so hard. I probably couldn't even pass it. How did you do?,A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!,5081
5082,apprehensive,I didn't know that. Congratulations. That's so awesome.,I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!,5082
5083,sentimental,That must have been nice. I keep cards too.,I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.,5083
5084,sentimental,Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards  photos  school projects. Everything. We arent here forever,It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel  if someone's taken the time to write  I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?,5084
5085,sentimental,I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol,That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!,5085
5086,sentimental,Lol. Me too!!,I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with  lol.,5086
5087,embarrassed,Why was it slippery,When I was entering the store it was really slippery.,5087
5088,embarrassed,Oh no  were you okay,It had been raining   so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.,5088
5089,faithful,Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?,I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.,5089
5090,faithful,Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!,I don't want to out her to her husband  usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.,5090
5091,jealous,Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?,I feel kind of blue today  they announced the parts for the annual play.,5091
5092,jealous,I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.,I did  and it is a good one  just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.,5092
5093,trusting,That is wonderful  I imagine she is very excited.,I'm teaching my daughter how to drive  and so far  so good!,5093
5094,trusting,Okay i see well  take your time she will be getting her liscense soon,She is!  At first  though  she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road  so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.,5094
5095,trusting,She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.,Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.,5095
5096,trusting,It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.,I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!,5096
5097,ashamed,That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?,My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.,5097
5098,ashamed,I'm sure you will get it done!,I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse  I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom  shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*,5098
5099,trusting,Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?,My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.,5099
5100,trusting,I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that,We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.,5100
5101,trusting,I am jealous lol,We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.,5101
5102,trusting,I will work on it with my family. ,Don't be! There are many  many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :),5102

5106,apprehensive,Well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!,I got the assignment yesterday  and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week  and then after that I'll be on my own.,5106
5107,devastated,Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?,I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.,5107
5108,devastated,Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?,Only for funerals  unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life  I'm afraid.,5108
5109,devastated,96! Wow. Thats a full life!,Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here  but she was 96  so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!,5109
5110,devastated,Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.,She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!,5110
5111,excited,Excellent! Are you enjoying it?,I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before,5111
5112,excited,Sick. I hope it's as fun as it looks!,I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.,5112

She's such a wonderful mother.,5113
5114,grateful,I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.,I'm sorry to hear that  I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger  but I am blessed she's still here.,5114

5122,caring,Cool.  Some birds shouldn't be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it,I did not  I was little but I think I put it back into a tree,5122
5123,anxious,That is a nerve-racking experience. But I'm betting you did graduate and did just fine!,Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving,5123
5124,anxious,Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.,Yep  had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out,5124

5126,embarrassed,Yeah  I'd be pretty scared too  but it's better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest,I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :( ,5126
5127,embarrassed,Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?,I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party  not my greatest moment,5127

5130,terrified,Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I could've touched it. Glad you're free of those dreams now.,Yeah  it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me  pretty weird,5130
5131,guilty,So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?,I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards,5131

5154,trusting,Nice  I am jealous of your friendship!,I think I am getting her a gift soon!,5154
5155,ashamed,Was it something important that you took ?,I stole from my friends when I was a child. I feel terrible about it now,5155
5156,ashamed,I see  did they ever find out it was you ?,It was some Pokemon cards!,5156
5157,devastated,That is awful  I am sorry to hear that.  Is he doing better now?,My father almost passed away last year. It was very tough on everyone,5157
5158,devastated,I'm so glad he is better.  Is the whole family doing alright?  I know that can be really hard on people.,Yes  he has made a full recovery! It's been a journey,5158
5159,sentimental,Life was easier back then  Hopefully you still love life?,I remember when I was a young one. I loved life.,5159
5160,sentimental,Nostalgia can stir emotions. You'll find something to love about life again.,I do  but maybe not with he same flare as before,5160

5166,embarrassed,That is the best way to handle those situations.,Yeah  we all have a good laugh about it now,5166
5167,disgusted,Ouch! I can relate. What made you decide to drink a whole gallon in a day?,Drinking a gallon of milk in a day wasn't a good idea,5167
5168,disgusted,Haha! I hope you experience no seriously ill effects!,I wanted to see how hard it would be  turns out my stomach was JUST big enough,5168
5169,jealous,Sheesh that is brutal  did you smack him?,My friend slept with a girl I like. I feel horrible now,5169
5170,jealous,I don't blame you  that is low.,No  but I don't think he is my friend any more,5170
5171,sad,Me neither  I hate it when they just wont leave you alone,I don't like working with managers that try to micro-manage me,5171
5172,sad,Yes! I feel the same,Right  it kind of feels like they're insecure with their abilities while trying to make me feel bad at the same time,5172
5173,annoyed,Always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day  it helps,Teeth are weird  but also take a lot of upkeep which is sometimes irritating,5173
5174,annoyed,If you don't take care of your teeth then you will have a bad time later in life,Yeah that's what my dentist says  I'll try,5174
5175,afraid,That is bizarre  have you had this seen about?,I wake up with chills sometimes for no reason,5175
5176,afraid,That is odd  are you afraid when you wake up?,I think it's from dreams that I'm not able to recall,5176
5177,angry,You sound a lot like my husband. He is really into going to the gym. Life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time.,I wasn't able to reach my goals in the gym a couple days ago  and it helped me realize where I'm slacking off in other areas,5177
5178,angry,I agree. Its pretty cool to see the changes. I never really got into going to the gym though. ,Yeah  it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself  and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing,5178
5179,confident,I have been skydiving  too! It was a fun experience.,I recently went skydiving. It was a thrilling rush,5179
5180,confident,I lost my hearing for a few hours after though  but other than that it was a wonderful experience.,It was excellent. I feel so alive!,5180
5181,confident,That is great  did something recently happen?,I think I will have success in my life. I love life these days!,5181
5182,confident,Awesome! What type of music?,I recently finished a new album I have been working on!,5182
5183,excited,What possibilities do you speak of?,I'm excited to think of all the possibilities that are available to me at the moment,5183
5184,excited,That sounds pretty exciting.,Being able to learn basically anything with the internet for one,5184
5185,surprised,I've never been much for meditating. I'm glad you enjoy it.,I like meditating because it puts things into perspective in a way that I don't usually expect,5185
5186,surprised,What got you into meditation?,For sure  my mind is pretty energetic,5186
5187,lonely,I think that's a good idea so you aren't always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself.,I've been processing what being lonely feels like  because I want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes,5187
5188,lonely,Meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you.,True  and I've felt that way before  but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that  but it's all good,5188
5189,trusting,I used to struggle with the same problem  it can be overwhelming,I'm trying to get over my need to control things  and I find if I just let things happen it feels like a weights been pulled off my shoulders,5189
5190,trusting,I agree!!,Right  but things always seem to turn out for the best anyway,5190
5191,proud,Grats.  How long have you been working out for?,I grew up pretty skinny and now that I've grown some muscle I feel a lot more comfortable in my skin,5191
5192,proud,Keep your diet clean and you'll keep improving.,around 9 months  been pretty slow to make progress but overall it's been solid,5192
5193,prepared,That sounds nice. Hopefully it isn't too hot for you.,I am going to go camping tomorrow! The back's already packed,5193
5194,prepared,Are you going to be sleeping in a tent?,I hope not. I'm in Florida so it might get bad,5194
5195,sentimental,That's just so sad. House fires are terrifying to me.,My old house burned down  and I went to check it out  was surreal taking a look around the place,5195
5196,sentimental,The wiring was probably old and not up to code anymore.,Yeah  it was built a long time ago  some kind of electrical fire,5196
5197,devastated,did it go flat?,I was truly surprised when I notice my tire got hit by a rock  thought I wouldn't make it to the tire place in time,5197

5199,caring,That is really nice of you!  Is the cat OK now?,There was a cat who had string stuck around it so I had to help,5199
5200,caring,That's good.  If not for you  who knows what could have happened.  You must be a very caring individual.,Yeah  everything turned out fine in the end,5200
5201,faithful,I think that is a lovely thing,I feel like deepening my connection to God is the most important thing in my life,5201
5202,faithful,If its important  you will figure it out,It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life,5202
5203,anticipating,Yea  its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can,When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated,5203
5204,anticipating,I think relaxing is very important,Right  it's like I can't focus or relax,5204
5205,jealous,Yeah as a child it's hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you don't have that many.,When I was in elementary school I was envious of the kids who were popular!,5205
5206,jealous,Well  I hope you got over that issue and ended up making lots of friends yourself.,Yeah  I just had trouble socializing is all,5206
5207,confident,Oh man! thats impressive  those baths are rough.,When I do things that are challenging I feel more self-reliant. I recently tried taking an ice bath,5207
5208,confident,That's good. But still! You must be pretty tough!,Yeah  my bath wasn't deep enough  so I didn't get covered all the way!,5208
5209,prepared,Are you taking protein?,I'm eating a lot of food to make sure I can lift more weight in the gym next time!,5209
5210,prepared,That is good  hopefully it helps!,I'm taking everything  honey  raw garlic  yogurt  EVERYTHING!,5210
5211,furious,I agree  were you recently screwed by one?,I don't like scammy sales people  nothing good comes from it,5211
5212,furious,Yep its disgusting,Yeah  it's like they live to manipulate people for money,5212
5213,embarrassed,That is sweet of you  kids are cute,I went to lunch the other day with my kids. My daughter needed help opening her dipping sauce and of course I did....,5213
5214,embarrassed,Oh that is not good  I hope you were able to clean it up easily...,They are but when I finally got it open it sprayed me from my waste all the way to my hair! ,5214
5215,nostalgic,Wow I haven't thought of them in years.  Sometimes it is good to have bands you can always go back to,Listening to old artists like they Might Be Giants is my jam,5215
5216,nostalgic,True.  I have favorite bands to that I consider to be musical comfort food,Haha  I didn't grow up with them but it's like discovering a gold mine that no one else seems to listen to,5216
5217,hopeful,Nice! Are you getting a car soon too?,Getting my driver's license was a freeing experience,5217
5218,hopeful,Definitely  especially when you get really hungry at night. I love a good drive thru,Yeah  that was a while ago  cars are great in a lot of situationsz!,5218
5219,devastated,That is awful. I've had it happen to me once before.,I've had the worst week  someone stole my credit card information.,5219
5220,devastated,I sure hope so  too! It is a lot of work to get it sorted out. ,Yes it's been hell  they charged over 15 thousand dollars on it. I hope my identity is fine besides the card.,5220
5221,disappointed,Yeah... that seems like a hard gig  especially in today's day and age  where everyone's so wary  and especially since there's not often people at home during the day. You have to have good people skills to do that job  though. So  you at least probably have that going for you.,I was pretty disillusioned when I found out door to door sales wasn't a fun time,5221
5222,disappointed,Ah.. yeah  I'm sorry you had to run into that kind of problem. It's hard doing a job you don't agree with the ethics of. There's really no way to fake it sometimes. But at least you were able to realize that and stand by your morals.,I realized that it was unethical in the end!,5222
5223,jealous,Is he going out drinking?,Ugh  I'm so annoyed! My husband went out again with his friends  third time this week.,5223
5224,jealous,That is such a tough time  my son is teething as well,Yes  I'm exhausted. My daughter is teething so she hasn't been sleeping well.,5224
5225,disgusted,Well I am not a religious person but I will have to say it urks me when I am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me. Then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also,Seeing people taken advantage of by fake religious services is something I find the most vile. It makes them believe that they're doing the right thing  but the person taking advantage of them knows what's really up. What do you know about that?,5225
5226,disgusted,Lol. exactly how I feel,Exactly  I feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus  it'll slowly erode their ability to think rationally.,5226
5227,confident,Oh  thats not unusual. You must try to relax. Is it an important presentation?,I have a presentation for work on Monday  I'm a little nervous.,5227
5228,confident,I see  I hope it goes well for you. Remember to breathe! ,Kind of  but I have prepared a lot so I'm sure it'll go good! I work in the human resource department for a big company and we are trying to find new ways to retain good employes.,5228
5229,anxious,That is a scary situation. People do not care anymore.,I had to leave my key in my car for the mechanic and I was left wondering if someone might find it,5229
5230,anxious,You are so right! ,Right  there's too many people to say that it wouldn't happen,5230
5231,anticipating,That is awesome  what degree are you working towards?,This week was the last one for this semester of my college courses,5231
5232,anticipating,I can imagine  waiting sucks!,Healthcare administration  only 6 months left! I get so antsy waiting to see the final grades  it drives me crazy ,5232
5233,terrified,That's kind of odd. I probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct. What was the reason they wanted to wake you up?,I got woken up by my roommate and I swear his voice is the last thing you want to hear in the middle of the night  sent the fear of God through my veins,5233
5234,terrified,Hahaha.. that's kind of goofy in a way. Yeah  sometimes nothing good can come of people trying to get your attention randomly in the middle of the night. That's probably the wisest choice. I probably wouldn't be able to act that good enough to pull it off.,I don't know  I didn't answer  pretended I was asleep,5234
5235,ashamed,Ouch!  What did you take?,I almost got caught stealing  I felt pretty bad,5235
5236,ashamed,Was it an awesome keyboard worth getting in trouble for?,A computer keyboard from my school,5236
5237,prepared,Congrats! Thats so exciting do You fel ok?,I'm 38 weeks pregnant  could have my baby any day now!,5237
5238,prepared,YAY! good job! He/she is going to be beautiful,Yes  a bit nervous because my first birth was hard  but I know I'm ready and have everything we need for the baby! ,5238
5239,joyful,I still think it is  i always get so excited,Christmas was the best time of year back in the day!,5239
5240,joyful,yep thats one of the things that make it so nice,Yeah  it's like there's nothing to worry about,5240
5241,afraid,Oh wow that is weird. Did you say anything to him?,Some random dude walked into my room while I was laying down  couldn't have been more weird,5241
5242,afraid,Yeesh  how awkward is that.,I was like what the hell  and then he said sorry and walked out,5242
5243,furious,Were you able to take the plate id?,Someone hit my car at walmart today and drove off!,5243
5244,furious,I understand. Sorry to hear about that.,No  I didn't see it someone reported it to customer service and they paged me. I wish they would have left a note! People have so decency sometimes!,5244
5245,nostalgic,Oh nice. What kind of candy was it?,I saw my favourite candy at the store today! Was so excited  hadn't seen it in a while.,5245
5246,nostalgic,Oh yeah I think I have tried that one! I love anything by Haribro! ,This sour s'ghetti candy by HARIBRO. I use to eat this all the time as a child.,5246
5247,hopeful,Glad to hear it. I hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid. But at least she'll have a good perspective and appreciate life more.,My daughter has been sick for months but she is finally starting to get better!,5247
5248,hopeful,Even if she does  it will help make her a well-rounded  relatable person. Usually these things help ground kids and give them character. But maybe you're right  if she moves on from it quickly  that's great too!,Thank you  Defenitly! She is still young and most likely won't remember this either! ,5248
5249,impressed,What had he made in the world?,My friend showed me his Minecraft world and it was amazing! Looked like he spent days on it,5249
5250,impressed,That's super cool  I played a few years back but eventually quit.,He had created one giant hole and filled it up with water  super cool,5250
5251,disappointed,I am really sorry to hear that.  I hope everything is alright.,I had to cancel our family vacation coming up next month.,5251
5252,disappointed,Well  that is just terrible.  I hate it when companies jerk you around like that.  I hope you will be able to reschedule it  although I know that wouldn't make up for the frustration.,Yes  his work told him he couldn't go after they already approved the time off. Guess next month is going to be busy at his work :(,5252
5253,grateful,that is a great way to look at it,Life is good  it's the gift that keeps on giving,5253
5254,grateful,Yeah more people should look at life like you do,Glad you think so as well!,5254
5255,disgusted,did you call the exterminator?,I saw a huge cockroach outside my house today!,5255
5256,disgusted,I live in Texas to so i know those feels,Not yet since it's the weekend. We live in Texas so they are common but still gross! I'm glad I haven't see any in my house.,5256
5257,anxious,What is the test on?,I have a big test on Monday  I am so nervous.,5257
5258,anxious,Chemistry is quite difficult have you studied hard?,It's for my Chemistry class. I haven't slept much because I'm worried so I keep studying.,5258
